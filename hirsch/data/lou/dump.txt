=====================================


        Oh hurrah I awake from yesterday
        alive but the war is here to stay
        so my love, my love and me
        decide to take our last walk through the noise to the sea
        Not to die but to be re-born
        away from the lands so battered and torn

        Forever, forever
        Forever, forever

        Say can you see it's really such a mess
        every inch of earth is a fighting nest
        giant pencil and lipstick tube shaped things
        continue to rain and cause screaming pain
        And the arctic stains from silver blue to bloody red
        as our feet find the sand and the sea -

        - Is straight ahead, straight up ahead
        is straight ahead, straight up ahead
        Is straight ahead, straight up ahead
        is straight ahead, straight up ahead

        Well it's too bad that our friends
        can't be with us today
        well the machine that we built
        would never save us, that's what they say
        That's why they ain't coming with us today
        and they also said
        you know good and well
        it would be beyond the will of God
        and the grace of the king

        Forever, forever
        Forever, forever

        Forever, forever

"A Dream"
=============================
album _Songs For Drella_
(Lou Reed/John Cale, 1990)

written by Lou Reed/John Cale

* poetry reading by John Cale
=============================


        It was a very cold clear fall night
        I had a terrible dream
        Billy Name and Brigid were playing
        under my staircase on the second floor
        about two o'clock in the morning

        I woke up
        because Amos and Archie had started barking
        That made me very angry
        because I wasn't feeling well and I told them
        I was very cross
        the real me
        that they just better remember
        what happened to Sam the Bad Cat
        that was left at home and got sick and went to pussy heaven

        It was a very cold clear fall night
        Some snowflakes were falling
        Gee, it was so beautiful
        and so I went to get my camera to take some pictures
        And then I was taking the pictures
        but the exposure thing wasn't right
        and I was going to call Fred or Gerry
        to find out how to get it set
        but, oh, it was too late
        and then I remembered they were still probably at dinner
        and anyway
        I felt really bad and didn't want to talk to anybody
        But the snowflakes were so beautiful
        and real looking
        and I really wanted to hold them
        And that's when I heard the voices
        from down the hall near the stairs
        So I got a flashlight
        and I was scared and I went out into the hallway
        There's been all kinds of trouble lately in the neighborhood
        and someone's got to bring home the bacon
        and anyway
        there were Brigid and Billy playing

        And under the staircase
        was a little meadow sort of like the park at 23rd street
        where all the young kids go and play frisbee
        Gee, that must be fun
        maybe we should do an article on that in the magazine
        but they'll just tell me I'm stupid and it won't sell
        But I'll hold my ground this time, I mean
        it's my magazine, isn't it?

        So I was thinking that as the snowflakes fell
        and I heard these voices having so much fun
        Gee, it would be so great to have some fun
        So I called Billy
        but either he didn't hear me or he didn't want to answer
        which was so strange
        because
        even if I don't like reunions I've always loved Billy
        I'm so glad he's working
        I mean it's different than Ondine
        He keeps touring with those movies
        and he doesn't even pay us and the film
        I mean the film's just going to disintegrate and then what
        I mean he's so normal off of drugs
        I just don't get it

        And then I saw John Cale
        he's been looking really great
        He's been coming by the office to exercise with me
        Ronnie said I have a muscle
        but he's been really mean since he went to AA
        I mean what does it mean
        when you give up drinking and then you're still so mean
        He says I'm being lazy but I'm not
        I'm just can't find any ideas
        I mean I'm just not
        let's face it
        going to get any ideas up at the office

        And seeing John made me think of the Velvets
        and I had been thinking about them
        when I was on St. Marks Place
        going to that new gallery those sweet new kids have opened
        but they thought I was old
        and then I saw the old DOM
        the old club where we did our first shows
        It was so great
        I don't understand about that Velvet's first album
        I mean I did the cover
        I was the producer
        and I always see it repackaged
        and I've never gotten a penny from it
        How could that be
        I should call Henry
        But it was good seeing John
        I did a cover for him
        but I did in black and white and he change it to color
        It would have been worth more if he'd left it my way
        but you can never tell anybody anything
        I've leaned that

        I tried calling again to Billy and John
        but they wouldn't recognize me it was like I wasn't there
        Why won't they let me in

        And then I saw Lou
        I'm so mad at him
        Lou Reed got married and didn't invite me
        I mean is it because he thought I'd bring too many people
        I don't get it
        He could have at least called
        I mean he's doing so great
        Why doesn't he call me?
        I saw him at the MTV show
        and he was one row away and he didn't even say hello
        I don't get it
        You know I hate Lou
        I really do
        He won't even hire us for his videos
        And I was so proud of him

        I was so scared today
        There was blood leaking thought my shirt
        from those old scars from being shot
        And the corset I wear to keep my insides in was hurting
        And I did three sets of fifteen pushups
        and four sets of ten situps
        But then my insides hurt
        and I saw drops of blood on my shirt
        and I remember
        the doctors saying I was dead
        And then later they had to take blood out of my hand
        'couse they'd run out or veins
        but then
        all this thinking was making me an old grouch
        and you can't do anything anyway so
        if they wouldn't let me play with them in my own dream
        I was just going to have to make another
        and another
        and another
        Gee, wouldn't it just be funny if I died in this dream
        before I could make another one up

        And nobody called

        And nobody came

        I had a terrible dream the other night

        Billy Name and Brigid were playing
        under my staircase on the second floor
        'bout two o'clock in the morning

        I woke up because Amos and Archie had started barking
        That made me very angry
        Because I wasn't feeling well

        And then I remembered they were still probably at dinner
        and anyway
        I felt really bad and didn't want to talk to anybody anyway
        but the snowflakes were so beautiful

        And real looking
        and I really wanted to hold them
        And that's when I heard the voices

        Gee, that must be fun
        Maybe we should do an article on that in the magazine
        But they'll just tell me I'm stupid and it won't sell
        But I'll just hold my ground this time
        I mean it's my magazine, isn't it?

        So I was thinking that as the snowflakes fell
        and I heard these voices having so much fun
        Gee, it would be so great to have some fun
        so I called Billy
        but either he didn't hear me or he didn't want to answer
        which was so strange
        because
        even if I don't like reunions I've always loved Billy

        I'm so glad he's working
        I mean it's different than Ondine
        He keeps touring with those movies
        and he doesn't even pay us
        And the film, I mean the film's just going to disintegrate
        And then what
        I mean he's so normal off of drugs
        I just don't get it

        And then I saw John Cale and he's been looking really great
        He's been coming by the office to exercise with me
        Ronnie said I have a muscle

        But he's been really mean since he went to AA
        I mean what does it mean
        when you give up drinking and then you're still so mean

        He says I'm being lazy but I'm not
        I'm just can't find any ideas
        I mean I'm just not
        let's face it
        going to get any ideas up at the office

        And seeing John made me think of the Velvets
        and I had been thinking about them
        when I was on St. Marks Place
        going to that new gallery those sweet new kids have opened
        but they thought I was old
        and then I saw the old DOM
        the old club where we did our first shows

        It was so great

        And I don't understand about that Velvet's first album
        I mean I did the cover
        I was the producer
        and I always see it repackaged
        and I've never gotten a penny from it

        How could that be

        I should call Henry
        But it was good seeing John
        I did a cover for him
        But I did in black and white
        And he change it to color

        It would have been worth more if he'd left it my way

        But you can never tell anybody anything
        I've leaned that

        I tried calling again to Billy and John
        but they wouldn't recognize me
        It was like I wasn't there

        Why won't they let me in

        And then I saw Lou
        I'm so mad at him
        Lou Reed got married and didn't invite me
        I mean is it because he thought I'd bring too many people

        I don't get it
        He could have at least called
        I mean he's doing so great
        Why doesn't he call me?
        I saw him at the MTV show
        and he was one row away and he didn't even say hello

        I don't get it
        You know I hate Lou, I really do
        He won't even hire us for his videos
        And I was so proud of them

        I was so scared today
        There was blood leaking thought my shirt
        from those old scars from being shot
        And the corset I wear to keep my insides in was hurting
        And I did three sets of fifteen pushups
        and four sets of ten situps
        But then my insides hurt
        and I saw drops of blood on my shirt and I realized
        And I remember the doctors saying I was dead
        And then later they had to take blood out of my hand
        'couse they'd run out or veins but then
        All this thinking was making me an old grouch
        and you can't do anything anyway
        so if they wouldn't let me play with them in my own dream
        I was just going to have to make another
        and another and another
        Gee, wouldn't it be funny if I died in this dream
        before I could make another one up

        And nobody called

        Thank you miss smarty
        it's been a party
        You might even say
        it's been a ball

        At first I thought you
        were sad I brought you
        But things worked out well
        after all

        It wasn't always love and laughter
        but we both come out better after
        And a good time
        yes, a good time

        Was had by all

"A Sheltered Life"
===========================
album _Rock And Roll Heart_
(Lou Reed, 1976)

written by Lou Reed
===========================


        Never been to England, never been to France
        never really learned how to dance
        I've never taken dope and I've never taken drugs
        ah, I've never danced on a bear skin rug

        Guess it's true what all those people they say
        I'm gonna have to lose my hometown ways
        Guess it's true, guess I've led a sheltered life

        Never went around with anything
        I've had a hometown life and I haven't ever learned to swing
        Not much of a life, I haven't seen much
        I've been true to my wife and it's just been too much

        Guess it's true what all these people they say
        I'm gonna have to lose my hometown ways
        You know it's true, guess I've led a sheltered life

        Guess it's true what all those people they say
        I'm gonna have to lose my hometown ways
        Guess it's true, guess I've led a sheltered life

"Sheltered Life"
(demo)
===============================
box set _Peel Slowly And See_
(The Velvet Underground, 1995)

early 1967
John Cale's Ludlow Street loft,
lower Manhattan, NYC
===============================


        Never been to London, never been to France
        never worn a sari, never learned to dance
        Never walked down to 42nd Street and Frairs
        never smoked any filtered air

        Guess it's true what all the people say
        gonna have to mend my old time ways, yeah
        I guess it's true, guess I've lived a sheltered life

        Never walked about on the streets at night
        never got into an uptown fight
        Never smoked a hookah, never saw a rug
        couldn't even squash a beetle bug

        Guess it's true I'm gonna have to change my ways
        guess it's true what all the people say, yeah
        I know it's true, guess I've lived a sheltered life

        Never went to parties in a chauffeured car
        never wore a top hat 'cause I won't get far
        Never learned to handle all the things that I've seen
        maybe I'll grow up to be big and mean

        Guess it's true what all the people say
        gonna have to change my old fashioned ways, well
        I guess it's true, guess I've lived a sheltered life

On the Lou Reed Guitar Archive
I found a mistake in "Sheltered Life".

The phrase "Never smoked a hook and never saw a rug"
should be "Never smoked a hookah, never saw a rug".

The Line "never was sorry, never learned to dance"
should be "never worn a sari, never learned to dance"

A sari is an (east) Indian garment,
consisting of a long piece of cloth, wrapped around the waist,
with one edge hanging down in the front,
and the other taken upand thrown over the head.

"A Wild Being From Birth"
=========================
album _The Raven_
(Lou Reed, 2003)

written by Lou Reed
=========================



Rowena:

        A wild being from birth
        My spirit spurns control
        Wondering the wide earth searching for my soul
        While all the world is chiding
        In visions of the dark night
        I have had a waking dream
        A holy dream
        A holy dream
        A waking dream of life and light
        That cheered me as a lovely beam
        A lonely spirit guiding
        With a ray turned back upon the past

        While I aghast
        Sit motionless through the misty night
        Dimly peering at what once shone bright
        Peeking wariy at what shone afar
        What could there be more purely bright
        In Truth's day-star?



Poe:

        In the consideration of the faculties
        and impulses of the human soul
        in consideration of our arrogance
        our radical, primitive, irreducible arrogance of reason
        we have all overlooked the propensity
        We saw no need for it
        the paradoxical something which we may call perverseness
        A mobile without motive
        Through its promptings, we act without comprehensible object
        Induction would have brought phrenology to admit this
        We act for the reason we should not
        For certain minds this is absolutely irresistible
        The conviction of the wrong or impolicy of an action
        is often the unconquerable force
        It is a primitive impulse
        Elementary
        The overwhelming tendency to do
        wrong for the wrong's sake
        This impels us to its persecutions
        Oh holy dream
        We persist in acts
        because we feel that we should not persist in them
        This is the combativeness of phrenology



Rowena:

        We have a task before us which must be speedily performed
        We know it will be ruinous to delay
        Trumpet-tongued, the important crisis of our life calls
        We glow



Poe:

        We are consumed with eagerness to commence work
        Yet a shadow flits across the brain
        The impulse increases to a wish
        the wish to a desire
        the desire to uncontrollable longing
        and the longing in defiance of all consequences is indulged
        We put off all until tomorrow



Rowena:

        We tremble with the violence of the conflict within us
        the definite with the indefinite
        the substance with the shadow
        There is no answer except that we feel perverse
        The shadow prevails
        Our energy returns
        We will commit now
        We will labor now
        Oh holiest of dreams
        but it is too late
        We stand upon the brink of the precipice



Poe:

        We grow sick and dizzy
        We go to shrink from danger but instead we approach it
        We are intoxicated by the mere idea
        of a fall from such a great height
        This fall, this rushing annihilation
        for the very reason
        it contains the most loathsome and ghastly images
        of death and suffering
        for this reason do we now most impetuously desire it
        There is no passion in nature
        so demonic as the passion of him who
        shuddering upon the edge, meditates a plunge
        We will these actions merely
        because we feel that we should not
        Having realized this, I swoon
        It is the spirit of the perverse
        The idea of a poison candle struck my fancy
        and I procured one for my victim
        I will not vex you with impertinent details
        but suffice it to say the verdict was
        "Death by the visitation of God"



Rowena:

        All went well for me



Poe:

        All went well for me



Rowena:

        His estate inherited
        I reveled in absolute security
        I would never be found out
        I was safe
        I was safe
        If I did not prove fool enough to make open confession



Poe:

        If I did not prove fool enough to make public confession
        No sooner had I uttered those words
        than I felt an icy chill creep into my heart
        I made a strong effort
        to shake off this nightmare of the soul
        I laughed
        I whistled
        I walked and then walked faster
        I thought I saw a formless shape approaching me from behind
        And then I ran
        I pushed and shoved blindly
        I thought I left a hand upon my throat
        no mortal hand
        I screamed
        and then clearly, clearly
        I enunciated pregnant sentences
        that consigned me to the hangman and the hell
        the fullest judicial conviction
        Today I wear chains but tomorrow I shall be fetterless
        But where?
        Oh holy dream
        Oh beam of light
        I fall prostrate with excitement this holy night

============================


        A world without heroes
        is like a world without sun
        You can't look up to anyone
        without heroes

        And a world without heroes
        is like a never ending race
        Is like a time without a place
        a pointless thing devoid of grace

        Where you don't know what you're after
        or if something's after you
        And you don't know why you don't know
        in a world without heroes

        In a world without dreams
        things are no more than they seem

        And a world without heroes
        is like a bird without wings
        Or a bell that never rings
        just a sad and useless thing

        Where you don't know what you're after
        or if something's after you
        And you don't know why you don't know

        In a world without heroes
        there's nothing to be
        It's no place for me

"Adventurer"
================================
album _Set The Twilight Reeling_
(Lou Reed, 1996)

written by Lou Reed
================================


        You're an adventurer
        you sail across the oceans
        you climb the Himalayas
        seeking truth and beauty as a natural state

        You're a queen reborn
        worshipped from above afar
        some see you as an elixir
        an elemental natural seeking perfect grace

        In a catacomb
        or cave of endless drawings
        prehistoric or religious
        your accomplishments prodigious
        seeking out the perfect tone

        Your language so clear
        your voice perfectly turning
        as in the city I sit yearning
        blowing rings of smoke from thin cigars
        or driving fast in foreign cars
        to capture your remains, huh

        You're an adventurer
        a turban wet wrapped 'round your head
        on the mountainside they predict your death
        oh how you fooled them all

        But subjects are a poor excuse
        when what you really want's a muse
        an inspirating knowledge
        of what comes before

        Ooohhh, speeds of light
        the momentary flicker
        of a candle in its wicker basket
        smoking wax, facts

        Did you find that superior knowledge
        that eluded you in college
        Did you find that super vortex
        that could cause your cerebral cortex
        ooohhh, to lose its grip

        You're an adventurer
        you were out looking for meaning
        while the rest of us were steaming
        in an inspirating
        ah, urban pit

        An adventurer
        you enter as I'm dreaming
        I wish I'd never wake up
        Differentiating scheming from my one true love

        You're an adventurer
        you love the angles and the cherries
        the height and width of levies
        the natural bridge and tunnels of the human race

        You're an adventurer
        nothing seem to scare you
        and if it does it won't dissuade you
        you just will not think about it
        you dismiss it and defocus
        you redefine the locus of your time in space, race

        As you move further from me
        and though I understand the thinking
        and have often done the same thing
        I find parts of me gone

        You're an adventurer
        and though I'll surely miss you
        and of course I'll survive without you
        and maybe good will come of that

        But at this point, ah
        I anticipate some grieving
        and although I know your leaving
        is a necessary adjunct to what we both do

        An adventurer
        splitting up the atom
        splitting up the once was
        splitting up the essence of our star-crossed fate

        None who meet you
        do forget you, my adventurer
        my adventurer, my adventurer-venturer
        my adventuress

"Sweet Jane"
==============================
album _Loaded_
(The Velvet Underground, 1970)

written by Lou Reed
==============================


        Standing on the corner
        suitcase in my hand
        Jack is in his corset, Jane is in her vest
        and me, I'm in a rock 'n' roll band, huh
        Ridin' in a Stutz Bearcat, Jim
        you know those were different times
        Oh, all the poets they studied rules of verse
        and those ladies they rolled their eyes

        Sweet Jane, woh
        Sweet Jane, oh-oh
        Sweet Jane

        I'll tell you somethin' that Jack, he is a banker
        and Jane, she is a clerk
        And both of them save their monies
        hah, and when, when they come home from work
        Ooohhh-wah, sittin' down by the fire, oh-wah
        the radio does play a little classical music there, Jim
        "The March Of The Wooden Soldiers", all you protest kids
        you can hear Jack say, get ready, ah

        Sweet Jane, ah, come on baby
        Sweet Jane, oh-oh-oh-ah
        Sweet Jane

        Some people they like to go out dancing
        and other peoples they have to work, just watch me now
        And there's even some evil mothers, haha
        well they're gonna tell you that everything is just dirt
        You know that women never really faint
        and that villains always blink their eyes, ooohhh
        And that, you know children are the only ones who blush
        and that life is just to die

        But anyone who ever had a heart
        oh, they wouldn't turn around and break it
        And anyone who ever played a part
        oh, they wouldn't turn around and hate it

        Sweet Jane, oh, wow-woh
        Sweet Jane

        Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane
        Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane
        Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane

"Intro / Sweet Jane"
====================================
album _Rock 'N' Roll Animal_
(Lou Reed, 1974)

"intro" part written by Steve Hunter

Dec 21, 1973
The Academy of Music, NYC
====================================


        Standing on the corner
        suitcase in my hand
        Jack's in his corset, Jane is in her vest
        me, honey, I'm in a rock 'n' roll band
        Ridin' in a Stutz Bearcat, Jim
        those were different times
        They studied rules of verse
        and ladies they rolled their eyes

        Sweet Jane
        Sweet Jane
        Sweet Jane

        Jack, he is a banker
        Jane, she is a clerk
        Both of them save their money
        when they come home from work
        Sittin' by the fire
        radio does play a little classical music there, kids
        "The March Of The Wooden Soldiers"
        you can hear Jack say

        Sweet Jane
        Sweet Jane
        Sweet Jane

        Some people like to go out dancing
        and other people like us, we gotta work
        There's even some evil mothers
        they'll tell you that life is just made out of dirt
        And women never really faint
        all the villains always blink their eyes
        That children are the only ones who blush
        and life is just to die

        Anyone who ever had a heart
        and wouldn't turn around and break it
        Anyone who ever played a part
        and wouldn't turn around and hate it

        Sweet Jane
        Sweet Jane
        Sweet Jane

        Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane
        Sweet Jane, oh honey, Sweet Jane
        Sweet Jane, oh, Sweet Jane
        Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane

"Sweet Jane"
==========================================
album _American Poet_
(Lou Reed, 2001)

Dec 26, 1972
Ultrasonic Recording Studio, Hempstead, NY
==========================================


        Standing on the corner
        suitcase in my hand
        Jack's in his corset, Jane is in her vest
        and me, I'm in a rock 'n' roll band, watch me now
        Ridin' in a Stutz Bearcat, Jim
        you know those were different times
        Those poets they studied rules of verse
        and the ladies they rolled their eyes

        Sweet Jane
        Sweet Jane
        Sweet Jane

        You know Jack, he is a banker
        and Jane, she is a clerk
        And both of them save their money
        and when they come home from work
        Yeah, sittin' there by the fire
        radio does play a little classical music there, kids
        "The March Of The Wooden Soldiers"
        and you can hear Jack say

        Sweet Jane
        Sweet Jane
        Sweet Jane

        La-la-la-la-la
        sha-la-la, hahaha..

        Some people are, they like to go out dancing
        and then other people like me, we gotta work
        And there's even some evil mothers
        they're gonna tell you that life is just made out of dirt
        That women never really faint
        that villains always blink their eyes
        Now little children are the only ones who blush
        and that life is just to die

        But anyone who ever had a heart
        oh, they wouldn't turn around and break it
        And anyone who ever played a part
        oh, they wouldn't turn around and hate it

        Sweet Jane
        Sweet Jane
        Sweet Jane

        Heavenly wine and roses
        seem to whisper to him, when she smile
        Heavenly wine and roses
        seem to whisper to him, when she smile

        Alright

        Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane
        Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane
        Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane
        Sweet Jane, Sweet Jane

album _Animal Serenade_
(Lou Reed, 2004)

* a lecture on the "4-chords" riff

Jun 24, 2003
The Wiltern, Los Angeles
==================================


        So I thought I would, I thought I would explain you
        how you make a career out of three chords

        I know a lot of you been wondering
        new younger bands pay attention at this one

        So you thought it's three, it's really four
        watch

        Three
        but what's really happening

        As in most things in life it's a little hop? at the end

unreleased live
(The Velvet Underground, 1970)

* different lyrics

Jan 02, 1970
The Second Fret, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
===========================================


        Anyone who's ever had a heart
        wouldn't turn around and break it
        And anyone who's ever played a part
        they wouldn't turn around and hate it

        Sweet Jane
        Sweet Jane
        Oh, Sweet-Sweet Jane

        Me, I'm standin' down on 4th street
        got about a dollar sixty in my hand
        Thought I'd go to a real good club
        and I'd go and I'd listen to a rock and roll band

        But I was really feelin' kinda silly
        didn't know just what to do
        You know you don't get many chances
        to have fun doin' the things that you do

        Sweet Jane
        Sweet Jane, hahaha..
        Sweet-Sweet Jane

        Waitin' around for Frankie
        he says that he's got a surprise
        Goin' up down to the 4th floor
        everybody's lookin' in my eyes

        But me, I'm feeling really handsome
        I figure that I can handle anything that comes
        But when everything got started
        it turned out that she was all thumbs

        And anyone who's ever had a heart
        wouldn't turn around and break it
        And anyone who's ever played a part
        you know they couldn't turn around and hate it

        Sweet Jane
        Sweet Jane
        Oh, Sweet-Sweet Jane

        Heavenly wine and roses
        seem to whisper to me, when you smile
        Heavenly wine and roses
        seem to whisper to me, when you smile

        La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la
        la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la

I figured out the lyrics of Sweet Jane
from the album Live Take No Prisoners.
English is not my native language,
so there may be some mistakes in them.
Anyway, this is at least better then no lyrics at all.

==

Standing on the corner
suitcase in my hand
Jack is in his corset, Jane is in her vest
I hear you
I hear you knocking but you can't come in
to me
Hey honey, I'm in a rock and roll band
and ridin' a Stutz Bearcat
those were different times
and those ladies they studied rules of verse
and all those ladies    , they rolled their eyes
and saying
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane

Now Jack, he is a banker
and Jane, she is just a little bitty clerk
And both of them
Hey you little people out there
I saw you little people
Don't you hated those Academy Awards, man?
You know they said: here's fucking Barbara Streisand
She says: I want to thank all those little people
There's too many little people
I can't get there names
Fuck her and you little people
I like big people
Fuck short people and tall people, man, I like middle people
People from Wyoming
You've ever meet sombody from Wyoming?
Not me

Anyway:
Now Jack, he is a banker
and Jane, she is a clerk
Hey clerk
Gimme good clerk
I give good clerk

And both them man, they saved their pennies
and their fucking nickels and their dimes, and it builts up
they got a estate
here comes the condominium
oh shit

He Miami
You're sitting there by the fire man
So let your fire, you plug it in
I like make believe fire
I like make believe love too
Oohh mama, give me some make believe love
Hey: Make believe love: that's a album title, Michael,
write that down, quick,
and fuck if I forget it

You're listening to some classical music, hey,
you better watch me now
It's only one time one time only to vote

Hey, The March Of The Wooden Soldiers
Have you ever put a quarter in those machines man?
You know: like the bear that playes basketball?
You put a quarter in

Aha
I guess you never put a quarter in it ha?

Some people say I'm residu
Haha
The March Of The Wooden Soldiers

Where were you on the list when they called you for Vietnam?
Hey man: Vietnam
Are you political Lou?
Political about what?
Give me an issue, I give you a tissue
And wipe my ass with it
Ooh yeah
We're just here to make out
You bend over
We put the head in, you know
if you don't like it
then we'll talk about it
Face north, Jack

You know,there's some people man , they like to go out dancing
Why should you?

You know I found my wife in the living room in a Volkswagen

Made a ride through the kitchen
Ain't that funny, haha?

And there's some evil motherfuckers
oh, oh, oohh,

and that eh
ah man, those pretty women they never really faint
Those villians always shut up you
And blink there eyes
There little bitty children are the onely ones that blush
And that life
Life is just to die
But i'll tell you something
Hey man, anyone who's got a heart
a rock and roll heart
Would you turn around and break it?
And you know
Do that again Michael

Is that control?

Honey I'm in a rock 'n' roll band
Ridin' a Stutz Bearcat
Those were different times
Oh, all the poets, they studied rules of verse
And all those ladies, they rolled their eyes

And say Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane

Now Jack, he is a banker
And Jane, she's just a little bitty clerk
And both of them

Anyway

Now Jack he is a banker
And Jane she's a clerk
Hey clerk, give me good clerk, I give good clerk aha

and their fucking nickels
and their dimes and bills up they got a nest egg.
Here comes the condominium. Oh shit, ey Miami.

You know like the bear that plays basketball.
You put a quarter in. Aha. I guess he put a quarter in.

This is just from memory,
because it's been a while since I listened to "Take No Prisoners,"
but you've got a few things wrong on the Sweet Jane lyrics
for the album.

Lou doesn't say, "What do I look like, any young man";
he says, "What do I look like, Henny Youngman . . ."

The punchline for the Henny Youngman joke is
"made a right at the kitchen."

The line about the fire is
"it's an electric fire--you plug it in."

_Animal Serenade_ talking part:


so i thought i would explain you
how you make a career out of three chords.
i know a lot of you been wondering.
new younger bands pay attention at this one.
so you thought it's 3 but it's really 4, watch,
3.
but what's really happening
as in most things in life it's a little hop? at the end.

"After Hours"
==============================
album _The Velvet Underground_
(The Velvet Underground, 1969)

written by Lou Reed
==============================


        one, two, three
        If you close the door
        the night could last forever
        Leave the sunshine out
        and say hello to never

        All the people are dancing
        and they're having such fun
        I wish it could happen to me

        But if you close the door
        I'd never have to see the day again

        If you close the door
        the night could last forever
        Leave the wine-glass out
        and drink a toast to never

        Oh, someday I know
        someone will look into my eyes
        And say hello
        you're my very special one

        But if you close the door
        I'd never have to see the day again

        Dark party bars, shiny Cadillac cars
        and the people on subways and trains
        Looking gray in the rain, as they stand disarrayed
        oh, but people look well in the dark

        And if you close the door
        the night could last forever
        Leave the sunshine out
        and say hello to never

        All the people are dancing
        and they're having such fun
        I wish it could happen to me

        Cause if you close the door
        I'd never have to see the day again
        I'd never have to see the day again, once more
        I'd never have to see the day again

In "After Hours", according to my ears the line should be:

"Looking gray in the rain, as they stand disarrayed"

not:
"Looking gray in the rain, as they stand a surrey"

"All Through The Night"
==============================
album _The Bells_
(Lou Reed, 1979)

written by Lou Reed/Don Cherry
==============================


        Don't you feel so lonely when it's in the afternoon
        and you gotta face it
        all through the night
        Don't it make you believe
        that something's gonna have to happen soon
        oh baby, all through the night

        All through the night
        oh baby, all through the night
        All through the night
        all through the night

        Have you ever played with an all-night band
        and gone through it, baby
        all through the night
        When the daytime descends in a nighttime of hell
        everybody's gone to look for a bell to ring
        all through the night
        And they do it, all through the night
        babe, all through the night
        When the words were down and the poetry comes
        and the novel's written and the book is done
        you said, oh Lord, lover, baby give it to me
        all through the night
        And she says it

        My best friend Sally, she got sick
        and I'm feeling mighty ill myself it happens all the time
        and all through the night
        I went to St. Vincent's and I'm watching the ceiling
        fall down on the body as she's lying there on the ground
        says oh babe, gotta celebrate all through the night
        Made me feel so sad I cried all through the night
        I said oh Jesus, all through the night
        If the sinners sin and the good man's gone
        and a woman can't come and help him home
        and what you gonna do about it
        when they go on all through the night
        And they sing, oh baby, oh baby, oh baby
        all through the night
        and he says give it to me all through the night
        It ain't so much when a man's gotta cry
        give a little loving and some piece of mind
        I said hey babe, give it to me all through the night

        And some people wait for things that never come
        and some people dream of things that never been done
        they do it, oh baby, all through the night
        The city's funny and the country's quiet
        but I'd wanna know why they don't have a riot
        why don't they do it, baby, all through the night
        Ooohhh mama, ooohhh mama, tell me about it
        all through the night
        I want to have it all through the night
        If Christmas comes only once a year
        why can't anybody shed just one tear
        for things that don't happen all through the night
        Ooohhh mama, all through the night
        oh baby, do it to me all through the night
        Easy, easy, baby, why don't you give it to -
        - me all through the night, yeah

        And what costume shall the poor girl wear
        To all tomorrow's parties
        A hand-me-down dress from who knows where
        To all tomorrow's parties

        And where will she go and what shall she do
        When midnight comes around
        She'll turn once more to Sunday's clown
        And cry behind the door

        And what costume shall the poor girl wear
        To all tomorrow's parties
        For Thursday's child is Sunday's clown
        For whom none will go morning

        A blackened shroud, a hand-me-down gown
        Of rags and silks, a costume
        Fit for one who sits and cries
        For all tomorrow's parties

        To all tomorrow's parties
        A hand-me-down dress from who knows where
        To all tomorrow's parties

        And where will she go and what shall she do
        When midnight comes around
        She'll turn once more to Sunday's clown
        And cry behind the door

        And what costume shall the poor girl wear
        To all tomorrow's parties
        Why silks and linens of yesterday's gowns
        To all tomorrow's parties

        And what will she do with Thursday's rags
        When Monday comes around
        She'll turn once more to Sunday's clown
        And cry behind the door

        And what costume shall the poor girl wear
        To all tomorrow's parties
        For Thursday's child is Sunday's clown
        For whom none will go morning

        A blackened shroud, a hand-me-down gown
        Of rags and silks, a costume
        Fit for one who sits and cries
        For all tomorrow's parties

        And what costume shall the poor girl wear
        To all tomorrow's parties
        A hand-me-down dress from who knows where
        To all tomorrow's parties

        And where will she go and what shall she do
        midnight comes around
        She'll turn once more to Sunday's clown
        And cry behind the door

        hello, I must be going
                (hello, I must be going)
        I met myself
                (I met myself)
        a year from today
                (a year from today)
        what a shock
                (oh what a shock)

        Alone at last
                (Alone at last)
        hello, I must be coming
                (hello, I must be coming)
        I ran into myself
                (I ran into myself)
        two years ago today
                (two years ago today)
        what a shock
                (oh what a shock)

        What did that girl look like that
        I never married
                (that I never married)
        I fly into the future and see her
                (I fly into the future and see her)
        with a baby carriage
                (with a baby carriage)
        (You didn't miss much old sport)
        (you'd be in a pauper's court)

        Look into the future, look into the past
        here I am alone at last

"Alone At Last"
===========================================
unreleased live
(Lou Reed, 1997)

* written for the play _Time Rocker_ (1996)

performed by
Lou Reed with his '98 backing band

Jul 03, 1997
Royal Festival Hall, London
(Meltdown Festival)
===========================================


        Alone at last
        hello, I must be goin'
        I met myself a year from today
        what a shock

        Alone at last
        hello, I must be comin'
        I ran into myself two years ago today
        what a shock
        ......

        What did that girl look like that I never married
        I fly into the future, see her with a baby carriage
        You didn't miss much old sport
        you'd be in a pauper's court

        Look into the future, look into the past
        here I am alone at last
        With history gone, tomorrows to come
        I witnessed the invention of the atomic bomb, ah

        I saw my own death, should I try to prevent it
        and if I did, could I live forever
        And never age and always be healthy
        could I change the times and become very wealthy

        Would history change because I had viewed it
        alone at last, alone at last
        Alone at last

        Here I am alone at last
        head on my shoulders, legs under my ass
        Before me the future, behind me the past
        the present always shifting

        If I knew what I, you ..... do
        ah, one is one and two is two
        But this is time I'll travel through

        Alone at last, ooohhh, alone at last, ah
        alone at last
        Alone at last, alone at last
        future past

_Between Thought And Expression - The Lou Reed Anthology_

        Oh, say, can you see
        by the dawn's early light
        What so proudly we hailed
        at the twilight's last gleaming
        Whose broad stripes and bright stars
        through the perilous fight
        O'er the ramparts we watched were so
        gallantly streaming

        America, America
        America
        America, America
        America

        And the rockets' red glare
        the bombs bursting in air
        Gave proof through the night
        that our flag was still there
        Oh, say, does that star -
        - spangled banner yet wave
        O'er the land of the free
        and the home of the brave

        America, America
        America
        America, America
        America
        America, America
        America

OH, SAY, can you see, by the dawn's early light, 
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming,
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?

And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof thro' the night that our flag was still there.
Oh, say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave!

AMERICA.....       AMERICA......     AMERICA.......

album _Transformer_
(Lou Reed, 1972)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        If I could be anything
        in the world that flew
        I would be a bat and come
        swooping after you
        And if the last time you were here
        things were a bit askew

        Well you know what happens after dark
        When rattlesnakes lose their skins and their hearts
        And all the missionaries lose their bark

        Oh, all the trees are calling after you
        And all the venom snipers after you
        Are all the mountains bolder after you

        If I could be any one of the things
        in this world that bite
        Instead of an indentured ocelot on a leash
        I'd rather be a kite
        And be tied to the end of your string
        and flying in the air, baby, at night

        'Cause you know what they say about honey bears
        When you shave off all their baby hair
        You have a hairy minded pink bare bear

        And all the bells are rolling out for you
        And stones are all erupting out for you
        And all the cheap bloodsuckers are flying after you

        Yesterday Daisy May and Biff
        were groovin' on the street
        And just like in a movie
        her hands became her feet
        Her belly button was her mouth
        which meant she tasted what she'd speak, ooohhh

        But the funny thing is what happened to her nose, ooohhh
        It grew until it reached all of her toes, ooohhh
        Now when people say her feet smell they mean her nose

        And curtains laced with diamonds dear for you
        And all the Roman noblemen for you
        And kingdom's Christian soldiers dear for you
        And melting ice cap mountains tops for you
        Oh-oh, and knights in flaming silver robes for you
        And bats that with a kiss turn prince for you
        Swoop-swoop, oh baby, rock-rock
        Swoop-swoop, rock-rock
        Swoop-swoop, rock-rock

However, I'm nearly positive that the lyric from
Andy's Chest is not either of the following:

        If I could be any one
        of the things in this world that bite
****    Instead of attention or slow on a leash
****    I'd rather be your kite

        If I could be any one of the things
        in this world that bite
****    Instead of being a tethered ocelot on a leash
****    I'd rather be your kite

Rather, it is:

        If I could be any one of the things
        in this world that bite
        Instead of a dentured ocelot on a leash
        I'd rather be a kite

I could be wrong,
but if you listen to the song a few times with that lyric in mind,
I think you'll find it sounds right.
It drove me nuts trying to figure out
what he was saying at that point in the song,
until a friend told me.

"Animal Language"
=========================
album _Sally Can't Dance_
(Lou Reed, 1974)

written by Lou Reed
=========================


        Miss Riley had a dog
        she used to keep it in her back yard
        And when the dog began to bark
        all the neighbors began to shout
        Then came a stormy night
        Miss Riley let her dog out
        And when the neighbors found him round
        they put a gun down his mouth and shot him down
        and he went -

        Ooohhh wow, bow wow
        Ooohhh wow, bow wow

        Miss Murphy had a cat
        on her lap it sat
        And once in a great big while
        it looked like that Cheshire Cat did smile
        But often it used to chase
        anything that crossed its face
        But one day it got so hot
        that Cheshire Cat had a blood clot
        and she said -

        Ooohhh meow, me meow
        Ooohhh meow, me meow

        Meow

        Then the dog met the cat
        the dog was hot and the cat was wet
        Then in came some sweaty dude
        he put a board between the two
        Then they couldn't get at it
        got frustrated all about it
        So they did the only thing you could do
        they took the dude's sweat and shot it up between the two
        and they said -

        Ooohhh wow, bow wow
        Ooohhh wow, bow, meow, wow

"Annabel Lee/The Bells"

album _The Raven_
(Lou Reed, 2003)

written by Lou Reed
=======================



Annabel Lee:

        Let the burial rite begin
        The funeral song be sung
        An anthem for the queenliest dead
        That ever died so young

        Sweet Lenore has gone before
        Taking hope that flew beside
        Leaving instead the wild dead child
        That should have been your bride

        It was many and many a year ago
        In a kingdom by the sea
        She was a child and you were a child
        In the kingdom by the sea

        But the moon never beams
        The stars never rise
        No angels envy thee
        For Ligeia rests dead
        With three winged seraphs
        In this kingdom by the sea

        Wedded darkly
        Soul to soul
        You shrink in size
        Down to a mole
        And disappear into the hole
        Of the dark mind's imaginings

        Shrinking

        Shrinking

        Shrinking

i thought i'd send in a little chord correction..
on the lou demo 'are you falling in love',
youve presented the third chord of the chorus as 'F6' ...
actually the chord you have there
(which is an F major chord with a G note on the E string)
is called F major 9th, or Fmaj9 for short.
F6 is a different chord altogether -
it has the same notes as Dm7 (F, D, A, C).
the sixth note in the F scale is D, not G.

"Average Guy"
=====================
album _The Blue Mask_
(Lou Reed, 1982)

written by Lou Reed
=====================


        I ain't no Christian or no born-again saint
        I ain't no cowboy or a Marxist D.A.
        I ain't no criminal or Reverend Cripple from the right
        I am just your average guy, trying to do what's right

        I'm just your average guy
        an average guy
        I am just your average guy
        I'm just an average guy

        Average guy, I'm just your average guy
        I'm average looking and I'm average inside
        I'm an average lover and I live in an average place
        you wouldn't know me if you met me face to face

        I'm just your average guy
        average guy
        Average guy
        I'm just an average guy

        I worry about money and taxes and such
        I worry that my liver's big and it hurts to the touch
        I worry about my health and bowels
        and the crime waves in the street
        I'm really just your average guy
        trying to stand on his own two feet

        I'm just your average guy
        I'm just your average guy
        I'm just your average guy
        average guy

        Average looks, average taste
        average height, an average waist
        Average in everything I do
        my temperature is 98.2

        I'm just your average guy
        an average guy
        Average guy
        I'm just your average guy
        Average guy
        I'm just your average guy
        I'm just your average guy
        I'm just your average guy
        Average

"Average Guy"
=======================
album _Live In Italy_
(Lou Reed, 1984)

Sep 07 (or 10), 1983
Verona (or Rome), Italy
=======================


        I ain't no Christian or no born-again saint
        I ain't no criminal or no Marxist D.A.
        I ain't no cowboy, Reverend Cripple from the right
        I am just your average guy, trying to do what's right

        I'm just your average guy
        oh, your average guy
        I'm just your average guy
        I'm just your average guy

        An average guy, I'm just your average guy
        I'm average looking and I'm average inside
        I got an average place and I lived in an average place
        you wouldn't recognize me if you met me face to face

        I'm just your average guy
        your average guy
        Baby, just your average guy
        I'm just your average guy

        I worry 'bout money, taxes and such
        I worry that my liver's big and it hurts to the touch
        I worry about crime waves and battles in the street
        I'm really just your average guy, trying to .... his feet

        I'm just your average guy
        your average guy
        Your average guy
        your average guy

        Average looks, average place
        average look, average waist
        I'm average in everything I do
        my temperature is 98.2

        I'm just your average guy
        your average guy
        Your average guy
        your average guy
        Average guy

        Well I'm so tired of your lyin'
        tryin' to paint a pretty picture, boy
        it's down right embarrassin' to me
        Hey, I know you're a hitter
        from the corner of the city
        just a cool Puerto Rican on the scene

        I'd spill myself out on the table
        if for one time I were able
        to get it up on the roof and just do
        But I'm always getting wasted
        by the man I call my best friend
        that I met under the third El Avenue

        I said, oh Co'lorado, Co'lorado
        Aye Co'lorado, Hell's kitchen desperado

        You wake up every mornin'
        with the sweat pourin' down you
        while you're starin' down you new used shiny gun
        Hey, I caught you in the parlour
        cause you know it made the girls holler
        across your arm a tattoo reading, mom

        Hey, it's me that's rejected
        cause your splittin's so perfected
        yeah, I'm a Puerto Rican and man, I'm gettin' so mean
        I know it's my porno mind
        that makes you feel it's worth the grind
        that rollin' look so I'll try and keep a clean machine

        I said, oh Co'lorado, hey Co'lorado
        Aye Co'lorado, Hell's kitchen desperado

        Oh Co'lorado, Co'lorado

        Hey, I'll catch ya down on Rivington and Ridge

"Baby Face"
=========================
album _Sally Can't Dance_
(Lou Reed, 1974)

written by Lou Reed
=========================


        Jim, living with you's not such fun
        You're not the only one
        You don't have the looks
        you're not the person that you used to be
        And there are people on the street that would go for me

        And I said no no no no no
        baby face
        And I said no no no no no
        baby face

        I met you in a bar in L.A.
        I was not feeling so good
        You did the proper moves
        you did everything that you should
        But now you're making a mistake
        and somebody else will take your place
        You're taking drugs over me

        And I said no no no no no
        I said now no no no no no
        I said now no no no no no
        baby face
        I said now no no no no no
        baby face

        You're not the kind of person
        it's easy to live with in a house
        I cook all your meals
        I make sure that you work out
        But lately it's been gettin' so hard
        (man you don't split your stash or your bread)
        the way you talk, ooohhh, the way you walk
        (you can keep it)
        And I'm not sure exactly what it's all about

        And I said no no no no no
        baby face
        I said now no no no no no
        baby face
        I said now no no no
        I said now no no no no
        ooohhh baby face, ah huh, ooohhh
        No no baby, baby
        No way now baby face
        uh uh

===================
"Baton Rouge"
===================
album _Ecstasy_
(Lou Reed, 2000)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        When I think of you Baton Rouge
        I think of a mariachi band
        I think of sixteen and a crisp green football field
        I think of the girl I never had

        When I think of you Baton Rouge
        I think of a back seat in a car
        The windows are foggy and so are we
        as the police asked for our I.D.

        So helpless
        so helpless

        Ooohhh, so helpless
        ooohhh, so helpless
        Ooohhh, so helpless
        so helpless

        Well I once had a car lost it in a divorce
        the judge was a woman of course
        She said give her the car and the house and your taste
        or else I set the trial date

        So now when I think of you Baton Rouge
        and the deep southern belles, ah, with their touch
        I wonder where love ends and hate starts to blush
        in the fields in the swamps in the rush

        In the terra-cotta cobwebs of your mind, ah
        when did you start seeing me as a spider spinning web
        Of malicious intent and you as poor poor me
        at the fire at the joint, this disinterred and broken mount
        in the bedroom in the house where we were unmarried

        So helpless, so helpless
        so helpless
        So helpless, so helpless
        so helpless

        When was I the villain in your heart
        putting the brake on your start
        you slapped my face and cried and screamed
        that's what marriage came to mean
        The bitterest ending of a dream

        You wanted children and I did not
        was that what it was all about
        You might get a laugh when you hear me shout
        you might get a laugh when you hear me shout
        I wish I had


        So helpless, so helpless
        so helpless
        So helpless, so helpless
        so helpless

        Sometimes when I think of Baton Rouge
        I see us with two and a half strapping sons
        One and a half flushed daughters preparing to marry
        and two fat grandsons I can barely carry

        Daddy, uncle, family gathered there for grace
        a dog in a barbecue pit goes up in space
        The dream recedes in the morning with a bad aftertaste
        and I'm back in the big city worn from the race of the chase
        what a waste

        So thanks for the card the announcement of child
        and I must say you and Sam look great
        Your daughter's gleaming in that white wedding dress
        with pride
        sad to say I could never bring that to you that wide smile

        So I try not to think of Baton Rouge
        or of a, of a, of a mariachi band
        Or of sixteen and a crisp green football field
        and the girl, and the girl I never had, had, had, had

        So helpless, so helpless
        so helpless
        So helpless, so helpless
        so helpless

When I think of you Baton Rouge
I think of a Mariachi band
I think of 16 and a crisp green football field
I think of the girl I never had
When I think of you Baton Rouge
I think of a back seat in a car
The windows are foggy and so are we

So helpless
So helpless
Ooohhh, ooohhh, so helpless
Ooohhh, so helpless

Well I once had a car
Lost it in a divorce
The judge was a woman of course

So now when I think of you Baton Rouge
and the deep southern belles with their touch

And you as poor poor me

So helpless

Sometimes when I think of Baton Rouge
I see us with 2 1/2 strapping sons
1 1/2 flushed daughters preparing to marry
and two fat grandsons I can barely carry
Daddy, uncle, family gathered there for grace
A dog in a barbecue pit goes up in space
The dream recedes in the morning with a bad aftertaste
And I'm back in the big city worn from the race of the
chase what a waste

So thanks for the card
The announcement of child
And I must say you and Sam look great
Your daughter's gleaming in that white wedding dress

Sad to say I could never bring that to you

So I try not to think of Baton Rouge
Or of a, of a, of a Mariachi band
Or of 16 and a crisp green football field
and the girl, and the girl I never ha- ha- ha- had

So helpless

So helpless

"The Bed"
===================
album _Berlin_
(Lou Reed, 1973)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        This is the place where she lay her head
        when she went to bed at night
        And this is the place our children were conceived
        candles lit the room brightly at night

        And this is the place where she cut her wrists
        that odd and fateful night
        And I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, what a feeling
        And I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, what a feeling

        This is the place where we used to live
        I paid for it with love and blood
        And these are the boxes that she kept on the shelf
        filled with her poetry and stuff

        And this is the room where she took the razor
        and cut her wrists that strange and fateful night
        And I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, what a feeling
        And I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, what a feeling

        I never would have started if I'd known
        that it'd end this way
        But funny thing, I'm not at all sad
        that it stopped this way

        This is the place where she lay her head
        when she went to bed at night
        And this is the place our children were conceived
        candles lit the room brightly at night

        And this is the place where she cut her wrists
        that odd and fateful night
        And I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, what a feeling
        And I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, what a feeling

Dec 15 (or 16), 2006
St. Ann's Warehouse, Brooklyn, NY
===========================================



        This is the place where she lay her head
        when she went to bed at night
        And this is the place where our children were conceived
        candles lit the room at night

        And this is the place where she cut her wrists
        that odd and fateful night
        And I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, what a feeling
        And I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, what a feeling

        (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, what a feeling)
        (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, what a feeling)

        This is the place where we used to live
        I paid for it with love and blood
        And these are the boxes she kept on the shelf
        filled with her, her poetry and stuff

        And this is the room where she took the razor
        and cut her wrists that strange and fateful night
        And I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, what a feeling
        And I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, what a feeling

        I never should've started if I'd known
        that it'd end this way
        But funny thing, I'm not at all sad
        that it stopped this way

        This is the place where she lay her head
        when she went to bed at night
        And this is the place our children were conceived
        candles lit the room brightly at night

        And this is the place where she cut her wrists
        that odd and fateful night
        And I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, what a feeling
        And I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, what a feeling

"Beginning Of A Great Adventure"
================================
album _New York_
(Lou Reed, 1989)

written by Lou Reed/Mike Rathke
================================


        It might be fun to have a kid
        that I could kick around
        a little me to fill up with my thoughts
        A little me or he or she
        to fill up with my dreams
        a way of saying life is not a loss

        I'd keep the tyke away from school
        and tutor him myself
        keep him from the poison of the crowd
        But then again pristine isolation
        might not be the best idea
        it's not good trying to immortalize yourself

        Beginning of a great adventure
        Beginning of a great adventure

        Why stop at one, I might have ten
        a regular TV brood
        I'd breed a little liberal army in the wood
        Just like these redneck lunatics
        I see at the local bar
        with their tribe of mutant inbred piglets with cloven hooves

        I'd teach 'em how to plant a bomb
        start a fire, play guitar
        and if they catch a hunter, shoot him in the nuts
        I'd try to be as progressive
        as I could possibly be
        as long as I don't have to try too much

        Beginning of a great adventure
        Beginning of a great adventure

        Susie, Jesus, Bogart, Sam
        Leslie, Jill and Jeff
        Rita, Winny, Andy, Fran and Jet
        Boris, Bono, Lucy, Ethel
        Bunny, Reg and Tom
        that's a lot of names to try not to forget

        Carrie, Marlon, Mo and Steve
        La Rue and Jerry Lee
        Eggplant, Rufus, Dummy, Star and The Glob
        I'd need a damn computer
        to keep track of all these names
        I hope this baby thing don't go too far

        I hope it's true what my wife said to me
        I hope it's true what my wife said to me, hey
        I hope it's true what my wife said to me

        She says, "Baby, it's the beginning of a great adventure"
        "Babe, beginning of a great adventure"
        "Take it, Lou"

        It might be fun to have a kid
        that I could kick around
        create in my own image like a god
        I'd raise my own pallbearers
        to carry me to my grave
        and keep me company when I'm a wizened toothless clod

        Some gibbering old fool
        sitting all alone drooling on his shirt
        some senile old fart playing in the dirt
        It might be fun to have a kid
        I could pass something on to
        something better than rage, pain, anger and hurt

        I hope it's true what my wife said to me
        I hope it's true what my wife said to me
        I hope it's true what my wife said to me
        She says, "Lou, it's the beginning of a great adventure"
        "Lou, Lou, Lou, beginning of a great adventure"
        She says, "Babe, how you call your lover boy"
        "Sylvia, quite you call your lover man"

"Beginning To See The Light"
==============================
album _The Velvet Underground_
(The Velvet Underground, 1969)

written by Lou Reed
==============================


        Well I'm beginning to see the light
        Well I'm beginning to see the light
        Some people work very hard
        but still they never get it right
        Well I'm beginning to see the light
        want to tell all you people now
        Now-now baby, I'm beginning to see the light
        Hey now baby, I'm beginning to see the light
        Wine in the morning
        and some breakfast at night
        Well I'm beginning to see the light

        Here we go again
        playing the fool again
        Here we go again
        acting hard again, all right

        Well I'm beginning to see the light
        I want to tell you, ooohhh
        Hey now baby, I'm beginning to see the light
        here it comes a softer now
        I wore my teeth in my hands
        so I could mess the hair of the night, a-ha-ha
        Hey, well I'm beginning to see the light
        Now-now-now-now-now-now-now-now baby
        I'm beginning to see the light now, it's coming softer
        Hey now baby, I'm beginning to see the light
        I met myself in a dream

        Hey now baby, I'm beginning to see the light

        Here comes two of you
        which one will you choose
        One is black and one is blue
        don't know just what to do, all right

        Well I'm beginning to see the light
        oh now here she comes, ooohhh
        Yeah-yeah baby, I'm beginning to see the light, oh

        but still they never get it right
        Well I'm beginning to see the light
        oh, it's getting a little softer in the end now
        Now-now baby, I'm beginning to see the light
        oh, it's coming round again
        Hey now-now-now baby, I'm beginning to see the light
        one more time
        There are problems in these times
        but, ooohhh, none of them are mine
        Oh baby, I'm beginning to see the light

        Here we go again

here's the lyrics to "Beginning to see the light"
from the 1969 Live album
that has some minor differences to the original version


Well, I'm beginning to see the light
Well, I'm beginning to see the light
Some people work very hard
But still they never do it right
Well, I'm beginning to see the light

Well, I'm beginning to see the light
Well, I'm beginning to see the light
A little wine in the morning
And some breakfast at night
Well, I'm beginning to see the light

Here we go again
Playing the fool again
Here we go again
Acting hard again, all right

Well, I'm beginning to see the light, here she comes, whooo-hooo
Well, I'm beginning to see the light
I wore my teeth in my hands
So that I could mess up the hair of the night
Well, I'm beginning to see the light

Yeah now baby, I'm beginning to see the light, see the light
Well, I'm beginning to see the light
I met myself in a dream
And I just wanna tell you it was all right
Well, I'm beginning to see the light

Here comes two of you
Which one will you choose
One is black and one is blue
Don't know just what to do, all right

Yeah now baby, I'm beginning to, oh, see the light now
it's comin' round
Hey, I'm beginning to see the light
Some people work very hard
But still they never do it right
Well, I'm beginning to see the light

Yeah now baby, I'm beginning to see the light, oh see the light
Oh baby, I'm beginning to see the light, see the light
There are problems in these times
But whooo, none of them are mine
Well, I'm beginning to see the light

Here we go again
I thought that you were my friend
Here we go again
I thought that you were my friend

How does it feel to be loved
How does it feel to be loved
How does it feel to be loved, hey, somebody tell me please
How does it feel to be loved, allright
How does it feel to be loved, oh oh

"The Bells"
===============================
album _The Bells_
(Lou Reed, 1979)

written by Lou Reed/Marty Fogel
===============================


        And the actresses relate
        to the actor who comes home late
        after the plays have gone down
        and the crowds have scattered around
        Though the city lights and the streets
        no ticket could be beat
        for the beautiful show of shows
        ah, Broadway only knows
        The Great White Milky Way
        it had something to say
        when he fell down on his knees
        after soaring through the air
        With nothing to hold him there
        it was really not so cute
        to play without a parachute
        as he stood upon the ledge
        Looking out he thought he saw a brook

        And he hollered, "Look, there are the bells"
        and he sang out, "Here come the bells"
        "Here come the bells"
        "Here come the bells"
        "Here come the bells"

        Here come the bells
        here come the bells
        Here come the bells
        here come the bells

album _Lou Reed_
(Lou Reed, 1972)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        In Berlin, by the wall
        you were five foot ten inches tall
        It was very nice
        candlelight and Dubonnet on ice

        We were in a small cafe
        you could hear the guitars play
        It was very nice
        it was paradise

        You're right and I'm wrong
        hey babe, I'm gonna miss you now that you're gone
        One sweet day

        Oh, you're right and I'm wrong
        you know I'm gonna miss you now that you're gone
        One sweet day
        One sweet day

        In a small, small cafe
        we could hear the guitars play
        It was very nice
        candlelight and Dubonnet on ice

        Don't forget, hire a vet
        he hasn't had that much fun yet
        It was very nice
        hey honey, it was paradise

        You're right and I'm wrong
        oh babe, I'm gonna miss you now that you're gone
        One sweet day
        You're right, oh, and I'm wrong
        you know I'm gonna miss you now that you're gone
        One sweet day
        One sweet day

        One sweet day, one sweet day
        oh, one sweet day
        One sweet day, baby baby, one sweet day
        one sweet day, one sweet day

==========================================


        By Berlin, by the wall
        you were five foot ten inches tall
        It was oh so nice
        hey honey, it was, candlelight and Dubonnet on ice

        We were in a small cafe
        and you could hear the guitars play
        It was oh so nice
        hey baby, it was a paradise

        You're right, woh, and I'm wrong
        you know I'm gonna miss you now that you're gone
        One sweet day

        You're right, woh, and I'm wrong
        you know I'm goin' to miss you now that you're gone
        One sweet day
        One sweet day

        we were in a small cafe
        you could hear the guitars play
        It was oh so nice
        candlelight and Dubonnet on ice

        Don't you forget, hire a vet
        he hasn't had that much fun yet
        It was oh so nice
        hey honey, it was paradise

        You're right and I'm wrong
        you know I'm goin' to miss you now that you're gone
        One sweet day
        You're right, woh, and I'm wrong
        you know I'm goin' to miss you now that you're gone
        One sweet day
        Oh oh, One sweet day

        One sweet day
        one sweet day
        One sweet day
        baby baby, one sweet day

in Berlin from the album Berlin.

"Betrayed"
========================
album _Legendary Hearts_
(Lou Reed, 1983)

written by Lou Reed
========================


        Betrayed by the one who says she loves you
        by the one who says she needs you
        above all other men
        Betrayed by her fragile, vicious beauty
        her father did his duty
        and I lay down betrayed

        Justice taught her competence
        her mother was like steel
        her cousins, they're all convicts
        she alone rose above that wheel
        But a motorcyclist no matter how good
        is slave to the oncoming truck
        and the poison of her father was
        her most pitiless luck

        Betrayed by the one who says she loves you
        by the one who says she needs you
        above all other men
        Betrayed by her fragile, vicious beauty
        her father did his duty
        and I lay down betrayed

        Three of us lie in this bed
        night of infamy
        one of us lies on our back
        her father's in her head
        And quick she turns and slaps my face
        and with her eyes open wide she screams
        I hate you, I hate you, I hate you
        but she's looking right past me

        Betrayed by the one who says she loves you
        by the one who says that she needs you
        above all other men
        Betrayed by her fragile, vicious beauty
        her father did his duty
        and I lay down betrayed

        And I lay down betrayed
        I lay down betrayed

"Big Sky"
===================
album _Ecstasy_
(Lou Reed, 2000)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        Big sky, big sky holding up the sun
        big sky, big sky holding up the moon
        Big sky holding down the sea
        but it can't hold us down anymore

        Big sky holding up the stars
        big sky holding Venus and Mars
        Big sky catch you in a jar
        but it can't hold us down anymore

        Big sky, big enormous place
        big wind blow all over the place
        Big storm wrecking havoc and waste
        but it can't hold us down anymore

        Ooohhh, big goals, big ambitious goals
        big talk, talking till I fold
        Big wind talking through torrential love
        but it can't hold us down anymore

        Big sin, big sin, big original sin
        paradise where I've never been
        Big snake break the skin
        but you can't hold us down anymore

        A big house holds a family
        a big room it holds you and me
        It's a big mess and baby makes three
        and you can't hold us down anymore

        Big news, they're out of their heads
        big-big-big news, let's fuck them instead
        There's a big joke did they think we were monks
        but they can't hold us down anymore

        A big doll, big enormous eyes
        big love holds you in a vise
        A big man who cut them down to size
        they can't hold us down anymore

        Big sky, big sky holding up the sun
        big sky holding, holding up the moon
        Big sky holding down the sea
        but it can't hold us down anymore

        Oh, big doll, big enormous eyes
        big love holds you in a vise
        A big man who cut them down to size, ah
        they can't hold us down anymore

        Oh-oh, big sky
        big sky
        Big sky
        ah, they can't hold us down anymore

They are the exact words he sings,
not just lyrics I copied from the booklet.



Big sky
-------
Big sky, big sky holding up the sun
Big sky, big sky holding up the moon
Big sky holding down the sea
But it can't hold us down anymore

Big sky holding up the stars
Big sky holding Venus and Mars
Big sky catch you in a jar
But it can't hold us down anymore

Big sky big enormous place
Big wind blow all over the place
Big storm wrecking havoc and waste
But it can't hold us down anymore

O big goals big ambitious goals
Big talk, talking till I fold
Big wind, talking through torrential love
But it can't hold us down anymore

Big sin, big sin, big original sin
Paradise where I've never been
Big snake break the skin
But you can't hold us down anymore

A big house holds a family
A big room it holds you and me
It's a big mess and baby makes three
And you can't hold us down anymore

Big news they're out of their heads
Big big big news let's fuck them instead
There's a big joke did they think we were monks
But they can't hold us down anymore

A big doll, big enormous eyes
Big love holds you in a vise
A big man who cut them down to size
They can't hold us down anymore

Big sky, big sky holding up the sun
Big sky, holding, holding up the moon
Big sky holding down the sea
But it can't hold us down anymore

Ooohhh big doll, big enormous eyes
Big love holds you in a vise
A big man who cut them down to size
Oh, they can't hold us down anymore

Ooohhh big sky
Big sky
Big sky
Aahh, they can't hold us down anymore

* a.k.a.
"The Biggest, The Loudest, The Hairiest Group Of All"
or
"The Biggest, The Loudest, The Hairiest"

Jan 29, 1972
Le Bataclan, Paris, France
=====================================================


        What's the date today
        Is it gonna rain
        Can I leave here now before the show

        Who's that other band
        Just another one night stand
        They can't sing and play as well as us

        Just a week ago we were in Texas
        Tomorrow night we play the Albert Hall
        I'm sorry there's no time to talk to you right now
        We're the biggest, the loudest, hairiest group of all

        We cut a record once
        it sold a lot in France
        Now we're getting tired of the game
        In and out of towns
        satisfying crowds
        Pillheads and the rest who come to hear

        But things were fine when we made the money roll
        Living off the fat of every land
        Slept with girls who couldn't read or write too well
        We're the biggest, the loudest, hairiest group of all

        Then the bubble broke
        we thought it was a joke
        We could make a come back any day
        We knew that we were right
        the band was out of sight
        The music's getting better all the time

        But the crowds got smaller every place we played
        And the clubs got dirtier as well
        When the music stopped it was quite plain to see
        The biggest, loudest, hairiest group of all

        Yeah, the biggest, the loudest, hairiest group of all
        Yes, the biggest, the loudest, the hairiest group of all

album _The Secret Policeman's Third Ball_
(Various Artists, 1987)

written by Peter Gabriel

performed by Peter Gabriel

Lou Reed: background vocals

Mar 1987
London Palladium, London, England
=========================================


        September '77
        Port Elizabeth weather fine
        It was business as usual
        in police room 619

        Oh, Biko, Biko
        because Biko
        Oh, Biko, Biko
        because Biko

        Yihla Moja, Yihla Moja
        the man is dead, the man is dead

        When I try to sleep at night
        I can only dream in red
        The outside world is black and white
        with only one colour dead

        Oh, Biko, Biko
        because Biko
        Oh, Biko, Biko
        because Biko

        Yihla Moja, Yihla Moja
        the man is dead, the man is dead

        You can blow out a candle
        but you can't blow out a fire
        Once the flames begin to catch
        the wind will blow it higher

"Billy"
=========================
album _Sally Can't Dance_
(Lou Reed, 1974)

written by Lou Reed
=========================


        Billy was a good friend of mine
        We grew up together ever since we were nine
        We went to school, he was my best friend
        And I thought our friendship would never end

        In high school he played football
        And me, I didn't do anything at all
        He made touch-downs while I played pool
        And no one could figure out which one of us was the fool

        Then we both went off to collage
        He studied medicine while I studied foliage
        He got A's, I got D's
        He was going for his Ph.D.
        Then I decided to drop out
        Things were getting a little too hot
        Billy stayed then became an intern then a doctor
        Then war broke out and he had to go
        But not me, I was mentally unfit or so they say, so-so

        When he came back, he wasn't quite the same
        His nerves were shot but not me
        Last time I saw him, I couldn't take it anymore
        He wasn't the Billy I knew, it was like talking to a door

        Billy was a friend of mine
        I grew up with him ever since I was nine
        We went together through school
        And now I often wonder which one of us was the fool

"The Black Angel's Death Song"
=======================================
album _The Velvet Underground and Nico_
(The Velvet Underground, 1967)

written by Lou Reed/John Cale
=======================================


        The myriad choices of his fate
        set themselves out upon a plate for him to choose
        What had he to lose

        Not a ghost-bloodied country all covered with sleep
        where the black angel did weep
        not an old city street in the east
        Gone to choose

        And wandering's brother walked on through the night
        with his hair, in his face
        long a long splintered cut from the knife
        Of G.T.

        The Rally Man's patter ran on through the dawn
        Until we said so long to his skull
        Shrill yell

        Shining brightly, red-rimmed and red-lined with the time
        effused with the choice
        of the mind on ice skates scraping chunks
        From the bells

        Cut mouth bleeding razors forget in the pain
        antiseptic remains coo goodbye
        So you fly to the cozy brown snow of the east
        Gone to choose, choose again

        Sacrificials remains make it hard to forget
        where you come from
        the stools of your eyes serve to realize pain
        Choose again

        And Roberman's refrain of the sacrilege recluse
        for the loss of a horse
        went the bowels in the tail of a rat
        Come again, choose to go

        And if epiphanies terror reduced you to shame
        have your head bobbed and weaved
        choose a side
        To be on

        If the stone glances off split didactics in two
        lay the color of the mouse trails
        all's green try between, if you choose
        If you choose, try to lose
        for the loss of remain come and start
        Start the game
        I chi-chi, chi-chi I
        chi-chi-chi, ka-ta-ko, choose to choose
        choose to choose, choose to go

"Black Angel's Death Song"
==============================
album _Live MCMXCIII_
(The Velvet Underground, 1993)

Jun 1993
L'Olympia, Paris, France
==============================


        The myriad choices of his fate
        set themselves out upon a plate for him to choose
        What had he to lose

        Not a ghost-bloodied country all covered with sleep
        where the black angel did weep
        not an old city street in the east
        Gone to choose, choose to go

        Wandering's brother walked on through the dawn
        with his hair, in his face
        long a long splintered cut from the knife
        From G.T.

        Cut mouth bleeding razors forget in the pain
        antiseptic remains coo goodbye
        So you fly to the cozy brown snow of the east
        Choose to go, choose to choose

        Roberman's refrain of the sacrilege recluse
        for the loss of a horse
        went the bowels in the tail of a rat
        Oh, oh, choose to go

        Sacrificials remains make it hard to forget
        where you come from
        the stools of your eyes serve to realize pain
        Choose to go

        If epiphanies terror reduced you to shame
        have your head bobbed and weaved
        choose a side
        Oh, to be on

        If the stone glances off split didactics in two
        lay the .... of the mouses
        all's green try between, if you choose
        If you choose, try to lose
        for the loss of remain come and start the game
        I chi-chi, chi-chi I
        chi-chi-chi, oh, ka-ta-ko, if you choose
        Choose to lose, choose to go

        The myriad choices of his fate
        set themselves out upon a plate for him to choose
        What had he to lose

        Not a ghost-bloodied country all covered with sleep
        where the black angel did weep
        just not an old city street in the east
        Gone to choose

        And wandering's brother ran on through the dawn
        Until we said so long to his skull
        Shrill yell

        Shining brightly, red-rimmed and red-lined with the time
        effused with the choice
        of the mind on ice skates scraping chunks
        From the bells, say so long

        The Rally Man's patter ran on through the dawn
        Until we said so long to his skull, shrill yell
        Gone to choose

        And the sacrificials remains make it hard to forget
        where you come from the stools
        of your eyes serve to realize pain
        Choose again

        antiseptic remains coo goodbye
        So you fly to the cozy brown snow of the east
        Gone to choose, choose again

        Roberman's refrain of the sacrilege recluse
        for the loss of a horse
        went the bowels in the tail of a rat
        From G.T.

        If epiphanies terror reduced you to shame
        have your head bobbed and weaved
        choose a side

        lay the color of the mouse trails

        Oh, if you choose, try to lose

Le Bataclan, Paris, France
===============================


        The myriad choices of his fate
        set themselves out upon a plate for him to choose
        What had he to lose

        Not a ghost-bloodied country all covered with sleep
        where the black angel did weep
        not an old city street in the east
        Gone to choose

        And the Rally Man's patter ran on through the dawn
        Until we said so long to his skull
        Shrill yell

        Shining brightly, red-rimmed and red-lined with the time
        effused with the mind on ice skates scraping bells
        from the chunks
        Say so long

        Cut mouth bleeding razors make it hard to forget
        where you come from
        the stools of your eyes serve to realize pain
        Ooohhh, come again

        And Roberman's refrain of the sacrilege recluse
        for the loss of a horse
        went the bowels in the tail of a rat
        Gone to choose, choose to go

        If epiphanies terror reduced you to shame
        have your head bobbed and weaved
        choose a side
        To be on

        If the stone glances off split didactics in two
        lay the color of the mouse trails
        all's green try between, but if you choose
        Oh, if you choose, choose to lose
        for the loss of refrain come and start
        Start the game
        I chi-chi, chi-chi I
        chi-chi-chi, ka-ta-ko, if you choose
        choose to lose, choose to go

===============================================


        The myriad choices of his fate
        set themselves out upon a plate for him to choose
        What had he to lose

        Not a ghost-bloodied country all covered with sleep
        where the black angel did weep
        not an old city street in the east
        Gone to choose

        Wandering's brother walked on through the dawn
        with his hair, in his face
        long a long splintered cut from the knife
        Of G.T.

        Rally Man's patter ran on through the dawn
        Until we said so long to his skull
        Shrill yell

        Shining brightly, red-rimmed and red-lined with the time
        effused with the choice
        of the mind on ice skates scraping chunks
        From the bells, say so long

        Cut mouth bleeding razors forget in the pain
        antiseptic remains coo goodbye
        So you fly to the cozy brown snow of the east
        Gone to choose, choose again

        Roberman's refrain of the sacrilege recluse
        for the loss of a horse
        went the bowels in the tail of a rat
        Choose to go

        If the stone glances off split didactics in two
        lay the color of the mouse trails
        all's green try between
        If you choose, choose to lose
        for the loss of remain come and start
        Start the game
        I chi-chi, chi-chi I

Lou Reed: spoken word
===================================


        I've passed that little black building down on the corner
        so many times
        and I often wondered if anyone lived there

        It looked like an empty dwelling with its cracked faade
        dusty windows
        curtains withdrawn
        no lights, no signs of anything

        I talked to Jewel about it
        she had the same idea

        That old guy that always hangs out
        outside the liquor store next door

        Reghmann

        told me he'd once seen the devil
        in one of those windows up there
        blowing him a kiss

        He had a certain serious
        almost eerie look on his face as he said it
        as if he'd actually seen the dark Lord
        said he'd seen him throw trash out of the back window
        that he'd been stealing the furniture
        from whatever bars closed down in the neighbourhood
        but he's an old guy
        probably delirious

        So anyway the other day me and Ricco decided to break in

        to see what the dark palace was really all about
        (it had a long tall hallway)
        it had a long tall hallway
        that led to a staircase in the back
        and on the right side
        I counted
        seven doors

        Who's that peeping through my door

        I can't stand it anymore
        I can't stand it anymore

"Blood Of The Lamb"

from the play _Time Rocker_
(Robert Wilson/Darryl Pinckney/Lou Reed, 1996)

written by Lou Reed

performed by actors, German musicians

Jun 11, 1996
Thalia Theater, Hamburg, Germany
(pre-premiere)
==============================================


        Who do you think you're kidding
        the blood of the lamb is unforgiving
        I'd rather have the head from the King of Siam
        or the heart of a prince from Pakistan

        Who do you think you're kidding
        this sacrifice is unforgiven
        Next thing kill me a firstborn son
        bring me the cock of a tortured bull
        The hand, the foot, the tongue
        the brain of a man

        Who do you think you're kidding
        the blood of the lamb is unforgiving
        Bring me the ears of a pharaoh's wife
        barbaric love masquerades as hate

        Who do you think you're kidding
        the blood of the lamb is unforgiving
        Blood on the altar, blood on the feet
        blood on the landscape, oh what a creep
        A river of blood is like a river of piss
        to me

        Who do you think you're kidding
        the blood of the lamb is unforgiving
        The tooth of a king, the scalp of a queen
        the light of the stars, the start of a scream

        Who do you think you're kidding
        the blood of the lamb can't be forgiven
        Blood on the hands, blood on the feet
        blood in the alleys, blood in the street
        Blood that won't wash off a river of piss
        to me

        Who do you think you're kidding
        Who do you think you're kidding

        Who do you think you're kidding
        the blood of the lamb can't be forgiven
        Who do you think you're kidding
        who do you think you're kidding
        Just a blood of the lamb
        can't be forgiven

"The Blue Mask"
=====================
album _The Blue Mask_
(Lou Reed, 1982)

written by Lou Reed
=====================


        They tied his arms behind his back
        to teach him how to swim
        They put blood in his coffee
        and milk in his gin
        They stood over the soldier
        in the midst of the squalor
        There was war in his body
        and it caused his brain to holler

        Make the sacrifice
        mutilate my face
        If you need someone to kill
        I'm a man without a will
        Wash the razor in the rain
        let me luxuriate in pain
        Please don't set me free
        death means a lot to me

        The pain was lean and it made him scream
        he knew he was alive
        They put a pin through the nipples on his chest
        he thought he was a saint
        I've made love to my mother, killed my father and brother
        what am I to do
        When a sin goes too far, it's like a runaway car
        it cannot be controlled

        Spit upon his face and scream
        there's no Oedipus today
        This is no play you're thinking you are in
        what will you say
        Take the blue mask down from my face
        and look me in the eye
        I get a thrill from punishment
        I've always been that way

        I loathe and despise repentance
        you are permanently stained
        Your weakness buys indifference
        and indiscretion in the streets
        Dirty's what you are and clean is what you're not
        you deserve to be soundly beat

        Make the sacrifice
        take it all the way
        There's no "won't" high enough
        to stop this desperate day
        Don't take death away
        cut the finger at the joint
        Cut the stallion at his mount
        and stuff it in his mouth

"Bottoming Out"
========================
album _Legendary Hearts_
(Lou Reed, 1983)

written by Lou Reed
========================


        I'm cruising fast on a motorcycle
        down this winding country road
        And I pass the gravel at the foot of the hill
        where last week I fell off

        There's still some oil by this old elm tree
        and a dead squirrel that I hit
        But if I hadn't left, I would have struck you dead
        so I took a ride instead

        Bottoming out
        bottoming out
        Bottoming out
        bottoming out

        My doctor says she hopes I know
        how lucky I can be
        after all it wasn't my blood
        mixed in the dirt that night

        But this violent rage, that turned inward
        can not be helped by drink
        And we must really examine this and I say
        I need another drink

        Bottoming out
        bottoming out
        Bottoming out
        bottoming out

        I'm tearing down Route 80 East
        the sun's on my right side
        I'm drunk, but my vision's good
        and I think of my child bride
        And on the left in shadows I see
        something that makes me laugh
        I aim that bike at that fat pothole
        beyond that underpass

        Bottoming out
        bottoming out
        Bottoming out
        bottoming out

        Bottoming out
        bottoming out
        Bottoming out
        bottoming out

"Burning Embers"
===================
album _The Raven_
(Lou Reed, 2003)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        Fly through the glass of a window pane
        fall through the sky feeling the rain
        Walk on broken glass your tell-tale heart

        Look through the bars of a dirty jail cell
        soar to heaven dive to hell
        Listen to your tell-tale heart

        Setting fires in the ghost twilight
        we see you dress we bolt with fright
        You see an apparition disappear

        Jump to the table, jump up the stairs
        stand on the rooftop, looking out through the air
        Walk on broken glass your tell-tale heart

        Lenore, am I dreaming

        How can death keep us apart, mmmm..
        Lenore, I see you burning

        And I'd walk on burning embers
        walk on burning embers
        Walk on burning embers your tell-tale heart

        Walk on burning embers
        walk on burning embers
        Walk on burning embers your tell-tale heart

        Walk on burning embers
        walk on burning embers
        Walk on burning embers your tell-tale heart

        Heart
        heart
        Heart
        heart

        Walk on burning embers
        walk on burning embers
        Walk on burning embers your tell-tale heart
        your tell-tale heart

        Walk on burning embers
        walk on burning embers
        Walk on burning embers your tell-tale heart

        Walk on burning embers
        walk on burning embers
        Walk on burning embers your tell-tale heart

        Walk on burning embers
        walk on burning embers
        Walk on burning embers your tell-tale heart

"Busload Of Faith"
===================
album _New York_
(Lou Reed, 1989)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        You can't depend on your family
        you can't depend on your friends
        You can't depend on a beginning
        you can't depend on an end

        You can't depend on intelligence
        ooohhh, you can't depend on God
        You can only depend on one thing
        you need a busload of faith to get by, watch, baby

        Busload of faith to get by
        busload of faith to get by
        Busload of faith to get by
        you need a busload of faith to get by

        You can depend on the worst always happening
        you can depend on a murderer's drive
        You can bet that if he rapes somebody
        there'll be no trouble having a child

        You can bet that if she aborts it
        pro-lifers will attack her with rage
        You can depend on the worst always happening
        you need a busload of faith to get by, yeah

        Busload of faith to get by
        busload of faith to get by
        Busload of faith to get by, baby
        busload of faith to get by

        You can't depend on the goodly hearted
        the goodly hearted made lampshades and soap
        You can't depend on the Sacrament
        no Father, no Holy Ghost

        You can't depend on any churches
        unless there's real estate you want to buy
        You can't depend on a lot of things
        you need a busload of faith to get by, woh

        Busload of faith to get by
        busload of faith to get by
        Busload of faith to get by
        busload of faith to get by

        You can't depend on no miracle
        you can't depend on the air
        You can't depend on a wise man
        you can't find 'em because they're not there

        You can depend on cruelty
        crudity of thought and sound
        You can depend on the worst always happening
        you need a busload of faith to get by, ha

        Busload of faith to get by
        busload of faith to get by
        Busload of faith to get by
        busload of faith to get by

I was just listening to the "Perfect Night Live in London" album,
and noticed Lou quotes Jesus Christ
at the very beginning of "Busload of Faith":

"O ye of little faith", he says.
Just thought I'd mention it.

"Call On Me"
====================================
album _The Raven_
(Lou Reed, 2003)

written by Lou Reed

sung by Lou Reed and Laurie Anderson
====================================


        Caught in the crossbow of ideas and journeys
        sit here reliving the other self's mournings
        Caught in the crossbow of ideas and dawnings
        stand I

        Oh oh oh oh

        Reliving the past of the maddening impulse
        violent upheaval, the pure driven instinct
        The pure driven murder, the attraction of daring
        stand I

        Why didn't you call on me
        why didn't you call on me
        Why didn't you call on me
        why didn't you call



Rowena:

        A wild being from birth
        my spirit spurns control
        wondering the wide earth
        searching for my soul
        Dimly peering
        I would surely find
        what could there be more purely bright
        in truth's day-star



        Ooohhh
        Why didn't you call on me
        why didn't you call, call on me
        Why didn't you call on me
        why didn't you call

"The Calm Before The Storm"
================================
album _Nothing But The Truth_
(Ruben Blades, 1988)

written by Lou Reed/Ruben Blades

Lou Reed:
co-arrangement, co-produce,
guitar, background vocals

(Mike Rathke:
guitar, background vocals)
================================


        There was a time when ignorance made
        our innocence strong
        There was a time when we all thought
        we could do no wrong
        There was a time, so long ago
        there was a time
        But here we are in the calm before the storm

        While the orchestra plays, they build barricades
        to help close the doors
        While the musician sings, the holocaust rings
        cymbals of war
        In the cities we stare at the things that were there
        and no longer are and in our hearts
        Here we are again in the calm before the storm, oh

        There was a time when we had an idea
        whose time hadn't come
        They kept changing its name, so we could still pretend
        it was not really gone
        We heard our screams turn into song
        and back into screams again and here we are again
        Here we are in the calm before the storm, oh

        Here we are, here we are
        in the calm before the storm

The Calm before the Storm (L.Reed-R.Blades););
   guitar: lou reed, mike rathke;
   arranged and produced by L. Reed-R.Blades;
   background vocals too.


lyrics:

there was a time when ignorance made our innocence strong.
there was a time when we all thought we could do no wrong.
there was a time, so long ago, there was a time...
but here we are, in the calm before the storm.

while the orchestra plays,
they build barricades to help close the doors.
while the musician sings, the Holocaust rings cymbals of war
in the cities we stare at the things that were there,
and no longer are.
and in our hearts, here we are again, in the calm before the storm.

there was a time, when we had an idea whose time hadn't come.
they kept changing its name,
so we could still pretend it was not really gone.
we heard our screams turn into song and back into screams again.
and here we are again, in the calm before the storm.

chorus: here we are, here we are, in the calm before the storm.

"I Can't Stand It"
===================
album _Lou Reed_
(Lou Reed, 1972)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        It's hard being a man
        living in a garbage pail
        My landlady called me up, ooohhh
        she tried to hit me with a mop

        I can't stand it anymore more
        I can't stand it anymore more, oh
        I can't stand it anymore more

        But if Candy would just come back
        it'd be all right
        Yeah, if Candy would just come back
        it'd be all right, come on baby

        I live with thirteen dead cats
        a purple dog that wears spats
        They're all out livin' in the hall
        and I can't stand it anymore

        I can't stand it anymore more
        I can't stand it anymore more
        I can't stand it anymore more

        But if Candy would just come back
        it'd be all right
        Ooohhh, if Candy would just come back
        it'd be all right, be all right now

        Ah, come on baby

        I'm tired of living all alone
        yeah, nobody ever calls me on the phone
        But when, ah, things start getting bad, ah
        I just play my music louder

        I can't stand it anymore more
        I can't stand it anymore more
        I can't stand it anymore more
        I can't stand it, I can't stand it, oh
        I can't stand it, I can't stand it
        I can't stand it, I can't stand it, no
        I can't stand it, I can't stand it, oh
        I can't stand it, I can't stand it
        I can't stand it, I can't stand it
        I can't stand it, I can't stand it
        I can't stand it, I can't stand it
        ...

"I Can't Stand It"
==============================
album _Live MCMXCIII_
(The Velvet Underground, 1993)

Jun 1993
L'Olympia, Paris, France
==============================


        It's hard being a man
        living in a garbage pail
        My landlady called me up
        tried to hit me with a mop

        Well I can't stand it anymore
        I can't stand it anymore more
        I can't stand it anymore

        Candy'd just come back
        it'd be all
        If Candy'd just come back
        it'd be all right

        I live with thirteen dead cats
        purple dog that wears spats
        livin' in the hall
        and I, I, I can't stand it anymore

        I can't stand it, I can't stand it anymore more
        I can't stand it, can't stand it anymore more more
        I can't stand it, stand it anymore

        But if Candy would just come back
        it'd be all right, ooohhh
        Candy'd just come back
        it'd be all right

        I live with thirteen dead cats
        purple dog that wears spats
        Where I'm livin' in
        and I can't stand it anymore

        I can't stand it anymore
        I can't stand it anymore
        I can't stand it anymore

        Candy'd just come back
        it'd be all right
        Candy'd just come back
        it'd be all right

        I can't stand it anymore
        I can't stand it any, ah
        I can't stand it any, ah

        I can't stand it, I can't stand it
        I can't stand it, I can't stand it
        I can't stand it, I can't stand it
        I can't stand it, I can't stand it, ah
        I can't stand it, I can't stand it
        I can't stand it, I can't stand it
        I can't stand it, I can't stand it
        I can't stand it, I can't stand it

        It's hard being a man

        I can't stand it anymore more
        I can't stand it anymore more
        I Can't stand it anymore more

        But if Shelley would just come back
        it'd be all right
        Shelley would just come back

in regards to your transcription of "I Can't Stand It"
on your Lou Reed site, you wrote for the third verse,

'But you say we'll just come back
would it be all right
You say we just come back
would it be all right'

What it is, is

'But if Shelley would just come back,
it would be all right
If Shelley would just come back,
it'd be all right'

you know, Shelley was his old girlfriend at Syracuse.
Also, the first verse, that's repeated again,
you keep changing it every time
into all these things that don't make sense.
it's the same as it is on "Lou Reed",


'It's hard being a man
Livin in a garbage pail
My landlady called me up
She tried to hit me with a mop'

if you listen closely you can hear it.
i'm sorry, i'm not criticizing you or anything,
i'm just trying to help you out.

"Candy Says"
==============================
album _The Velvet Underground_
(The Velvet Underground, 1969)

written by Lou Reed
==============================


        Candy says, I've come to hate my body
        And all that it requires in this world

        Candy says, I'd like to know completely
        What others so discreetly talk about

        I'm gonna watch the blue birds fly
        over my shoulder
        I'm gonna watch 'em pass me by
        maybe when I'm older

        What do you think I'd see
        if I could walk away from me

        Candy says, I hate the quiet places
        That cause the smallest taste of what will be

        Candy says, I hate the big decisions
        That cause endless revisions in my mind

        I'm gonna watch the blue birds fly
        over my shoulder
        I'm gonna watch 'em pass me by
        maybe when I'm older

        What do you think I'd see
        if I could walk away from me

        Doo doo wah
        Doo, doo doo wah
        Doo, doo doo wah
        Doo, doo doo wah
        Doo, doo doo wah
        Doo

written by Lou Reed
===================


        Caroline says that I'm just a toy
        she wants a man, not just a boy
        Oh Caroline says, ooohhh Caroline says

        Caroline says she can't help but be mean
        or cruel, or oh so it seems
        Oh Caroline says, Caroline says

        She says she doesn't want a man who leans
        Still she is my Germanic -

        - Queen
        Yeah, she's my Queen

        The things she does, the things she says
        people shouldn't treat others that way
        But at first I thought I could take it all

        Just like poison in a vial
        hey, she was often very vile
        But of course, I thought I could take it all

        Caroline says that I'm not a man
        so she'll go get it catch as catch can
        Oh Caroline says, yeah Caroline says

        Caroline says moments in time
        can't continue to be only mine
        Oh Caroline says, yeah Caroline says

        She treats me like I am a fool
        But to me she's still a German -

        - Queen, ooohhh, she's my -
        - Queen, you're -
        - Queen, hey baby, she's to my Queen

        Caroline says that I'm just a toy
        she wants a man, not just a boy
        Oh Caroline says, Caroline says

        Caroline says she can't help but be mean
        or cruel, or oh so it seems
        Yeah Caroline says, Caroline says, ah

        You know she doesn't like a man who lean
        But to me, she's just a German -

        - Queen
        Ah honey, she's just a Queen
        And you're not some quarter Queen

        The things she does, the things that she says
        hey, people shouldn't treat others that way
        But of course, I thought I could take it all

        Just like poison in a vial
        she was often very vile
        But of course, I thought that I could take it all

        Caroline says that I'm not a man
        so she'll go get it and catch as catch can
        Yeah Caroline says, oh Caroline says

        Caroline says that moments in time
        can't continue to be only mine
        Yeah Caroline says, Caroline says, faugh faugh faugh

        You know she treats me like a fool
        But to me she's a German -

        - Queen, hey, you're just a Queen
        Yeah, she's just a German Queen
        Oh, she's just a Queen

"Caroline Says II"

album _Berlin_

written by Lou Reed
===================


        Caroline says
        as she gets up off the floor
        Why is it that you beat me
        it isn't any fun

        Caroline says
        as she makes up her eye
        You ought to learn more about yourself
        think more than just I

        But she's not afraid to die
        all of her friends call her Alaska
        When she takes speed, they laugh and ask her

        What is in her mind
        what is in her mind

        Caroline says
        as she gets up from the floor
        You can hit me all you want to
        but I don't love you anymore

        Caroline says
        while biting her lip
        Life is meant to be more than this
        and this is a bum trip

        But she's not afraid to die
        all of her friends call her Alaska
        When she takes speed, they laugh and ask her

        What is in her mind
        what is in her mind

        She put her fist through the window pane
        It was such a funny feeling

        It's so cold in Alaska
        it's so cold in Alaska
        It's so cold in Alaska

"The Cask"
===================
album _The Raven_
(Lou Reed, 2003)

written by Lou Reed
===================



Edgar:

        Never bet the devil your head
        When I was an infant
        my mother treated me like a tough steak
        To her well regulated mind
        babies were the better for beatings
        But she was left handed
        and a child flogged left handed
        is better left unflogged
        The world revolves from right to left
        It will not do to whip a baby from left to right
        If each blow in the right direction
        drives an evil propensity out
        a blow in the opposite direction
        knocks it's quota of wickedness in

        Hence my precocity in vice
        my sensitivity to injuries
        the thousands of injuries heaped upon me by Fortunato
        and then finally his rabid insults for which I vowed revenge

        I gave no utterance to threat
        But the knowledge of "avengemenship"
        was so definite so precise
        that no risk could befall me
        by neither word
        nor deed had I given cause to doubt my good will
        I would punish with impunity
        I will fuck him up the ass and piss in his face
        I will redress the wrong
        But lips and psyche
        mind be silent
        Fortunato approaches



Fortunato:

        Don't take me to task
        for loving a cask
        The cask of Amontillado
        Please don't make a pass
        You can go kiss my ass
        All I want is this mythical cask
        The cask of Amontillado
        I've heard so much through the grapevine
        I've heard so much on the line
        But the one thing that I lust after
        Is the one thing I've never had
        So is it too much to ask
        Too have just one taste of the cask
        Why you could go kiss my ass for the cask
        of Amontillado

        Edgar old fellow
        dear bosom friend
        Hail fellow well met
        oh great elucidator
        great epopee



Edgar:

        Haha..
        Fortunato what luck to meet you
        what good good luck to meet
        you and see you looking so splendid
        I have received a cask of Amontillado
        or what passes
        for Amontillado



Fortunato:

        Amontillado
        That most wondrous sherry
        A cask
        Impossible
        How
        So rare



Edgar:

        I've had my doubts
        I was silly enough to pay the full price
        without consulting you in the matter
        but you were not to be found
        and I was fearful of losing a bargain



Fortunato:

        Fearfully stupid if you ask me Edgar



Edgar:

        I am on my way to see Mr. Bolo



Fortunato:

        A cask



Edgar:

        A cask
        To gather his opinion
        Are you engaged



Fortunato:

        Mr. Bolo cannot tell Amontillado from goat's milk



Edgar:

        Yet some say his taste is a match for your own



Fortunato:

        Hardly, dear boy
        Let us go



Edgar:

        Where



Fortunato:

        To your vaults to the supposed Amontillado



Edgar:

        Oh my good friend no
        I could not impose upon your good nature
        You have, after all, an engagement



Fortunato:

        To hell with the engagement
        I have no engagement
        Before the sky withers and falls let us go



Edgar:

        But the vaults are damp
        and I see you are afflicted with a severe cold



Fortunato:

        Oh let us go
        The cold is nothing
        You've been taken advantage of
        And Mr. Bolo cannot tell Amontillado from piss
        The cask



Edgar:

        It is farther on
        But see the white web work
        which gleams from these cavern walls



Fortunato:

        Nitre
        Nitre



Edgar:

        How long have you had that cough
        Yes, nitre



Fortunato:

        It is nothing



Edgar:

        We should go back
        Your health is precious
        You are a man who would be missed



Fortunato:

        [coughing]



Edgar:

        Let's return
        I cannot be responsible for causing you ill health
        And anyway there's always Mr. Bolo



Fortunato:

        Oh be damned, I'll not be swayed
        The cough is nothing
        It will not kill me
        I won't die of a cough



Edgar:

        Of that you can be sure
        Have some of this Medoc to warm the bones
        and defend you from this infernal dampness
        Drink
        Drink damn you



Fortunato:

        I drink to the buried that repose around us



Edgar:

        And I to your long life
        The nitre
        It hangs like moss
        We are below the river's bed
        The moisture trickles, chills the bones
        Let's go back
        Your cough



Fortunato:

        The cough is nothing
        Let us have some more Medoc
        Let us proceed to the Amontillado



Edgar:

        So proceed
        Herein the Amontillado
        Now Mr. Bolo



Fortunato:

        Mr. Bolo is an imbecile
        An ignoramus



Edgar:

        Can you not feel the nitre
        You really should go
        I implore you
        No
        Then I must leave you here
        But first
        let me render you all the little attentions within my power



Fortunato:

        The Amontillado
        Hahahaha..
        A very good joke indeed, haha..
        We will have many a rich laugh about it
        over our wine in the palazzo



Edgar:

        The Amontillado



Fortunato:

        Yes, yes yes
        The Amontillado



Edgar:

        Well
        Then let's go



Fortunato:

        Ah, for the love of God



Edgar:

        Precisely
        for the love of God
        Fortunato
        Fortunato

"The Cask"
========================================
from the play _POEtry_
(Robert Wilson/Lou Reed, 2000)

written by Lou Reed

performed by actors, local musicians (?)

May 09, 2001
Muziek Theater, Amsterdam, Holland
========================================



[The Cask Of Amontillado (spoken)]


        Never bet the devil your head
        When I was an infant
        my mother treated me like a tough steak
        To her well regulated mind
        babies were the better for beatings
        But she was left handed
        and a child flogged left handed is better left unflogged
        The world revolves from right to left
        It will not do to whip a baby from left to right
        If each blow in the right direction
        drives an evil propensity out
        a blow in the opposite direction
        knocks it's quota of wickedness in
        Hence my precocity in vice
        my sensitivity to injuries
        the thousands of injuries heaped upon me by Fortunato
        and finally his rabid insults for which I vowed revenge
        I gave no utterance to threat
        But the knowledge of "avengemenship"
        was so definite so precise that no risk could befall me
        by neither word nor deed
        had I given cause to doubt my good will
        I would punish with impunity
        I will fuck him up the ass and piss in his face
        I will redress the wrong

        .... (dialogue in German)
        ....
        ....

        I will fuck him up the ass and piss in his face
        I will redress the wrong
        But lips and psyche
        mind be silent
        Fortunato approaches




[The Cask (song)]


        Don't take me to task
        for loving a cask
        The cask of Amontillado

        Please don't make a pass
        you can go kiss my ass
        All I want is this mythical cask
        the cask of Amontillado

        I've heard so much through the grapevine
        I've heard so much on the line
        But the one thing that I lust after
        is the one thing I've never had

        So is it too much to ask
        too have just one taste of the cask
        Why you could go kiss my ass
        for the cask of Amontillado

"Catch 'Em In The Act"
===============================
album _Hitting The Ground_
(Gordon Gano, 2002)

written by Gordon Gano/Lou Reed

Lou Reed: vocals, guitar right
===============================


        This year's man is gonna be a man's man
        this little man is gonna be a man's man
        7-Eleven sells devil dogs and SPAM
        this year's man is gonna be a man's man

        This year's baby not gonna wet his booty
        this year's screamer gonna sniff too tooty
        Plurality of duty, singularity of beauty
        this little baby gets queer for big hot booty

        People come and go
        look at how they act
        they put down a scam
        I catch 'em in the act

        This little dog is gonna be a rottweiller
        this little bitch is gonna chew on an enchilada
        He's a husky at heart, she'd eat her own daughter
        this year's man is gonna take a poodle to the slaughter

        People come and go
        look at how they act
        they put down a scam
        and I catch 'em in the act

"Change"
===================
album _The Raven_
(Lou Reed, 2003)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        The only thing constantly changing is change
        and change is always for the worse
        The worm on the hook always eaten by a fish
        the fish by bird man or worse
        A spot on the lung, a spot on your heart
        an aneurism of the soul
        The only thing constantly changing is change
        and it comes equipped with a curse

        The only thing constantly changing is change
        and it's always for the worse
        The only thing constantly changing is change
        and it's always for the worse

        The only thing constantly changing is change
        the living only become dead
        Your hair falling out, your liver swelled up
        your teeth rot your gums and your chin
        Your ass starts to sag, your balls shrivel up
        your cock swallowed up in their sack
        The only thing constantly changing is change
        and it's always change on your back

        The only thing constantly changing is change
        and it's always for the worse
        The only thing constantly changing is change
        and it's always for the worse, baby

        The only thing constantly changing is change
        ashes to ashes to dusk
        The deer and the rabbit, the musk of your hole
        filled up with myriad dread, ooohhh
        The dread of the living, the dread of the living
        the frightening pulse of the night, ah
        The only thing constantly changing is change
        it's changes that will kill us with fright

        The only thing constantly changing is change
        and it's always for the worse
        The only thing constantly changing is change
        and it's always for the worse
        The only thing constantly changing is change
        the only thing constantly changing is change
        The only thing constantly changing is change
        and it comes equipped with my curse

"Change"
========================================
from the play _POEtry_
(Robert Wilson/Lou Reed, 2000)

written by Lou Reed

performed by actors, local musicians (?)

May 09, 2001
Muziek Theater, Amsterdam, Holland
========================================


        The only thing constantly changing is change
        change is always for the worse
        The worm on the hook eaten by a fish
        the fish by bird man or worse
        A spot on the lung, a spot on your heart
        an aneurism of the soul
        The only thing constantly changing is change
        and it comes equipped with a curse

        The only thing constantly changing is change
        and it's always for the worse
        The only thing constantly changing is change
        and it's always for the worse

        The only thing constantly changing is change
        the living only become dead
        Your hair falling out, your liver swelled up
        your teeth rot your gums and your chin
        Your ass starts to sag, balls shrivel up
        your cock swallowed up in their sack
        The only thing constantly changing is change
        and it's always change on your back

        The only thing constantly changing is change
        and it's always for the worse
        The only thing constantly changing is change
        and it's always for the worse

        The only thing constantly changing is change
        ashes to ashes to dusk
        The deer and the rabbit, the musk of your hole
        filled up with myriad dread
        Dread of the living, the dread of the living
        the frightening pulse of the night
        The only thing constantly changing is change
        changes will kill us with fright

        The only thing constantly changing is change
        and it's always for the worse
        The only thing constantly changing is change
        and it's always for the worse
        The only thing constantly changing is change
        and it's always for the worse
        The only thing constantly changing is change
        and it comes equipped with my curse

        they said everybody had to leave
        They had a warrant in their hand
        they wanted to bust the whole band
        I said if I ever see Sharon again

unreleased live
(Lou Reed, 1975)

* different lyrics

Jul 07, 1975
Perth, Australia
==================


        Everybody said that she's the one
        watch out even though she looks like fun
        She'll turn you in
        she knows a detective and his name is Jim
        you'd better, you'd better-better -

        Watch out, watch out for Charley's girl
        watch out for Charley's girl
        Watch out for Charley's girl
        watch out for Charley's girl

        When I heard about it instead
        I was glad that he wasn't dead
        When they knocked upon my door
        you know I'd been there before

        They had a search warrant to get it
        but it was all for him
        He once said you'd better help me out
        'cause Sharon's a bitch and she won't even help me out
        she'll turn me in, you'd better-better -

        Watch out, watch out for Charley's girl
        hey, watch out for Charley's girl
        she'll turn you in, you'd better -
        Watch out for Charley's girl
        watch out for Charley's girl
        Watch out

        Watch out for Charley's girl
        watch out for Charley's girl
        you'd better better better better -
        Watch out for Charley's girl

        You'd better watch out, you'd better -
        you'd better watch out
        you'd better watch out
        you'd better watch out
        You'd better watch out

=====================================
album _Chelsea Girl_
(Nico, 1967)

written by Lou Reed/Sterling Morrison

Lou Reed: guitar
=====================================


        Here's Room 506
        it's enough to make you sick
        Brigit's all wrapped up in foil
        you wonder if
        she can uncoil

        Here they come now
        see them run now
        Here they come now
        Chelsea Girls

        Here's Room 115
        filled with SM queens
        Magic marker row
        you wonder just
        how high they go

        Here they come now
        see them run now
        Here they come now
        Chelsea Girls

        Here's Pope dear Ondine
        Rona's treated him so mean
        She wants another scene
        she wants to be
        a human being

        Here they come now
        see them run now
        Here they come now
        Chelsea Girls

        Pepper she's having fun
        she thinks she's some men's son
        Her perfect loves don't last
        her future died
        in someone's past

        Here they come now
        see them run now
        Here they come now
        Chelsea Girls

        Dear Ingrid's found her lick
        she's turned another trick
        Her treats and times revolve
        she's got problems
        to be solved

        Here they come now
        see them run now
        Here they come now
        Chelsea Girls

        Poor Mary, she's uptight
        she can't turn out her light
        She rolled Susan in a ball
        and now she can't
        see her at all

        Here they come now
        see them run now
        Here they come now
        Chelsea Girls

        Drop-out, she's in a fix
        amphetamine has made her sick
        White powder in the air
        she's got no bones
        and can't be scared

        Here they come now
        see them run now
        Here they come now
        Chelsea Girls

        Here comes Johnny Bore
        he collapsed on the floor
        They shot him up with milk
        and when he died
        sold him for silk

        Here they come now
        see them run now
        Here they come now
        Chelsea Girls

        Here they come now
        see them run now
        Here they come now
        Chelsea Girls

I found another error,
this time in the lyrics for the Nico song "Chelsea girls".
In the first verse, third line is supposed to be:

Bridget's all wrapped up in foil

I'm not sure if it is spelled "Brigit",
which is one of the persons
involved with Andy Warhol and the Factory.

I found some errors in your lyrics for Chelsea Girls,
Velvet Nursery Rhyme and Lady Godiva's Operation.
Here are the correct ones:



Chelsea Girls 
        ==========
        Here's Room five four six
        it's enough to make you sick
        Bridget's all wrapped up in foil
        you wonder if
        she can uncoil

        Here they come now
        see them run now
        Here they come now
        Chelsea Girls

        Here's Room One fifteen
        filled with SM queens
        Magic marker row
        you wonder just
        how high they go

        Here's Pope dear Ondine
        Rona's treated him so mean
        She wants another scene
        she wants to be
        a human being

        Pepper she's having fun
        she thinks she's some men's son
        Her perfect loves don't last
        her future died
        in someone's past

        Dear Ingrid's found her lick
        she's turned another trick
        Her treats and times revolve
        she's got problems
        to be solved

        Poor Mary, she's uptight
        she can't turn out her light
        She rolled Susan in a ball
        and now she can't
        see her at all

        Dropout, she's in a fix
        amphetamine has made her sick
        White powder in the air
        she's got no bones
        and can't be scared

        Here comes Johnny Bore
        he collapsed on the floor
        They shot him up with milk
        and when he died
        sold him for silk

============================
"The City In The Sea/Shadow"
============================
album _The Raven_
(Lou Reed, 2003)

written by Lou Reed
============================



        Death has reared himself a throne



        In a strange city
        alone



        Death has reared himself a throne
        In a strange city
        alone
        Their shrines and palaces are not like ours
        They do not tremble and rot
        Eaten with time



        Death has reared himself a throne



        Lifted by forgotten winds
        Resignedly beneath the sky
        The melancholy waters lie
        A crown of stars



        In a strange city
        alone



        A heaven God does not condemn
        But the everlasting shadow
        Makes mockery of it all



        No holy rays come down
        Lights from the lurid deep sea
        stream up the turrets silently
        Up thrones, up arbors
        Of sculpted ivy and stone flowers
        Up domes, up spires
        Kingly halls all are melancholy shrines
        The columns, frieze and entablature
        Chokingly shockingly intertwined
        The mast, the viol, and the vine
        Twisted



        There amid no earthly moans
        Hell rises from a thousand thrones
        Does reverence to death
        And death does give his undivided time



        There are open temples and graves
        on a level with the waves
        Death looms and looks
        huge
        gigantic
        There is a ripple
        now a wave
        Towers thrown aside
        Sinking in the dull tide
        The waves glowing redder
        The very hours losing their breath



        Oh, the cunning stars
        watching fitfully over night after night of
        matchless wretched sleep
        matched only with the horror of the dream unfolding
        The tell-tale beating of the heart
        the suffocating breath
        The desire, the pose
        one poses upon the precipice
        to fall to run to dive to tumble to fall down
        down into the spiral down and then

        One sees one's own death
        one sees one committing murder or atrocious violent acts
        and then a cursed shadow
        not of man or God
        but the shadow resting upon the brazen doorway

        There were seven of us there
        who saw the shadow as it came out from among the draperies
        But we did not dare behold it
        We looked down into the depths of the mirror of ebony
        And the apparition spoke
        "I am a shadow
        and I dwell in the catacombs
        which border
        the country of illusion
        hard by the dim plains of wishing"

        And then did we start shuddering
        starting from our seats
        trembling
        for the tones in the voice of the shadow
        were not the tones of any one man
        but of a multitude of beings
        and varying in their cadences
        from syllable to syllable
        fell duskily upon our ears in the well-remembered
        and familiar accents of a thousand departed friends

"City Lights"
================================
album _The Bells_
(Lou Reed, 1979)

written by Lou Reed/Nils Lofgren
================================


        Don't these city lights
        light these streets to life
        Don't these crazy nights
        bring us together
        Any rainy day
        you can dance those blues away
        Don't these city lights
        bring us together

        Charlie Chaplin's cane
        well it flicked away the rain
        Things weren't quite the same
        after he came here
        But then when he left
        upon our own request
        Things weren't quite the same
        after he came here

        Don't these city lights
        bring these streets to life
        Don't these crazy nights
        bring us together
        Any rainy day
        you can dance those blues away
        Don't these city lights
        bring us together

        We're supposed to be
        a land of liberty
        And those city lights
        to blaze forever
        But that little tramp
        leaning on that street corner lamp
        When he left us
        his humor left us forever

        We're supposed to be
        a land of liberty
        And those city lights
        to blaze forever
        But that little tramp
        leaning on that street corner lamp
        When he left us
        his humor left us forever, ever

        Don't these city lights
        bring these streets to life
        Don't these crazy nights
        bring us together
        Any rainy day
        you can dance those blues away
        Don't these city lights
        bring us together
        Together

        No space, no rent
        the money's gone, it's all been spent now
        tell me 'bout your claim to fame

        Now ain't that some claim to fame

        Extra extra, read all about it now
        extra extra, something 'bout the claim to fame
        Ooohhh sweet mama, ooohhh sweet mama
        something 'bout a claim to fame

        Wet lips, dry mouth
        ready for that old hand out now
        ain't that some claim to fame

        Spaced out, spaced dead
        the head's round, the square is pegged
        ain't that some claim to fame

        Now tell me ain't that some claim to fame

        Extra extra, read all about it now

"Coney Island Baby"
=========================
album _Coney Island Baby_
(Lou Reed, 1976)

written by Lou Reed
=========================


        You know man when I was a young man in high school
        you believe it or not
        I wanted to play football for the coach
        And all those older guys
        they said that he was mean and cruel, but you know -
        I wanted to play football for the coach
        They said I was a little too light weight
        to play line-backer
        so's I'm playing right-end
        I wanted to play football for the coach
        'Cause you know someday man you gotta stand up straight
        unless you're gonna fall
        then you're goin' to die
        And the straightest dude
        I ever knew was standing right by me all the time
        So I had to play football for the coach
        Man I wanted to play football for the coach

        When you're all alone and lonely
        in your midnight hour
        And you find that your soul
        it's been up for sale

        And you begin to think 'bout
        all the things that you've done
        And begin to hate
        just 'bout everything

        But remember the princess who lived on the hill
        Who loved you even though she knew you was wrong
        And right now she just might come shining through
        and the -

        - Glory of love, glory of love
        glory of love, just might come through

        When all your two-bit friends
        have gone and ripped you off
        They're talking behind your back saying
        man, you're never gonna be no human being
        Then you start thinking again
        'bout all those things that you've done
        And who it was and what it was
        and all the different things you made every different scene

        Ah, but remember that the city is a funny place
        Something like a circus or a sewer
        And just remember different people have peculiar tastes
        and the -

        - Glory of love, the glory of love
        the glory of love, might see you through
        yeah, but now now
        Glory of love, the glory of love
        the glory of love, might see you through
        Glory of love, uh huh huh, the glory of love
        Glory of love, glory of love
        Glory of love now, glory of love now
        Glory of love now now now, glory of love
        Glory of love, give it to me now
        glory of love see you through (huh)
        I'm a Coney Island Baby now
        (I'm a Coney Island Baby now)
        I'd like to send this one out to Lou and Rachel
        and all the kids in PS 192
        Coney Island Baby
        Man I swear I'd give the whole thing up for you

"Coney Island Baby"
=========================
album _Take No Prisoners_
(Lou Reed, 1978)

May 1978
Bottom Line, NYC
=========================


        When I was a young man in high school
        I wanted to play football for the coach and
        Freeport, right
        Islip park, Massapequa park, Rockville Center
        The older guys said he's
        he's mean and he's cruel now
        I want to play football for the coach
        I was a little too light weight to go out for line-backer
        I wanted to be line-backer
        The grass is always greener
        so I went out for right-end
        Actually I was a pole vaulter
        I went out in the sectionals at eight-six, right
        That's pathetic, Big Mac, .....
        'Cause some day man you gotta stand up straight
        unless you're gonna fall and
        then you're goin' to die, going to die
        And the straightest dude
        I ever knew is standing right by me all the time
        but I had to play football for the coach
        And I wanted to play football for the coach
        I had to play ball with the coach
        and I wanted to do it with the coach

        When you're all alone and lonely
        baby babe you, it's your midnight hour
        And you find out that your soul
        don't you know that your soul has been up for sale

        Then you start thinkin' of
        baby, you've been doin' soon ..... drinkin' and
        thinkin' about all the things that you've done
        Listening to people that you said that shouldn't have fun -
        with who it was and what it was
        and all those things, all the things
        you hated everything I want
        everything I want

        Remember the princess on the hill
        Ah baby, baby, ah baby don't you know you was wrong
        Remember that a love just might come shining through but -

        Hey, the glory of love
        Ooohhh sweet nuthin'
        won't you tell me 'bout the glory of love
        Baby, how I miss your love and I need the glory of love
        It just might see you through
        Don't you know it might happen to you

        When all your two-bit friends they've gone
        and they ripped you right off says everything you ....
        They say, hey hey Lou Reed
        there's no way you'll live to be human being
        The things ain't what they seem
        I'm walking in a dream

        Then you start to thinking
        you're doing too much thinking and they said
        said, said, look at
        look at all those things that you've done
        And I said
        And what it was and who it was and
        all those things that I hate everything you want
        hate everything you want

        Remember that the city is a funny place
        Something like a circus or a sewer
        And right now, ah, just city's like a sewer for me, baby

        Ah baby babe, the glory of love

        I wanted to play football for the coach

        When you're all alone and you're lonely
        it's your midnight hour
        and you find that your very soul
        it's been up for sale

        You begin to think
        'bout all the things that you've done
        How much started
        that hate just 'bout everything you want

        Remember the princess on the hill
        Who loved you even though she knew you were wrong
        And right right now I love you just might come through
        and the -

        - Glory of love, glory of love
        Glory of love, might see you through

        When all your two-bit friends, they've gone
        and ripped you off
        And they're talking behind your back saying
        you're never be a human being

        You begin to think
        'bout all those things that you've done
        And who it was, what it was
        and all the different things you made everything want

        Remember that the city is a funny place
        Something like a circus or a sewer, ah
        Ah, and different people they got peculiar tastes
        and the -

        - Glory of love, the glory of love
        The glory of love, just might see you through
        Glory of love, ooohhh, the glory of love
        The glory of love, might come back through

        Glory of love, glory of love, give it to me now-now
        Glory of love, glory of love
        glory of love, give it to me now, glory of love
        Glory of love, glory of love

"Coney Island Baby"


When I was a young man in high school
I want to play football for the coach
Ah....
The older guys said he's he's mean and he's cruel now
I want to play football for the coach
I was to little too light weight to go out for line-backer
I want to line-backer
The grass is always green
So I went out for right-end
Actually I was ...
I went for the section at eight six right
That's pathetic
Big mac

Cause some day, man, you gotta stand up straight
Unless you're gonna fall
And then you're going to die
Going to die
And the straightest dude I ever knew
Was standing right by me, all the time
But I had to play football for the coach
And I wanted to play football for the coach
I have eightball with the coach
And I wanted to do it with the coach
When you're all alone and lonely baby baby in your midnight hour
And you find out that your soul don't you know that your soul,
it has been up for sale

And you start thinking ah baby
you've been doing too much drinking and thinking
Bout all the things that you've done
Listening people that ... that shouldn't have fun
with who it was and what it was
And all those things all those things you hear and this....
And this...

Remember the princess who lived on the hill
Oh man baby who loved you even though she knew you was wrong
And right now she just might come shining through and the -

Glory of love, glory of love
Uuh sweet nuthin' won't you tell me bout the glory of love
Oh baby I miss you now and the
Glory of love it just might see you through
Don't you know it might happen to you

And all your two-bit friends
they've gone and they ripped you right off
Says everything
Says Hey hey Lou Reed there's no way you live okay a human being
But things are not the same
You're walking in the train

And you start thinking you're doing too much thinking
And they said said said
Look at all those things that you've done
And I said what it was and and who it was
And all those things I hear that they say go on
Hey Lou they said Go on

Remember that the city is a funny place
Something like a circus or a sewer
And right now like a circus or a sewer for you baby

And baby baby the glory of love
And the glory of love, the glory of love
The glory of love, might see you through

Glory of love, the glory of love
The glory of love, might see you through

Glory of love don't you know, the glory of love
Glory of love, glory of love
Glory of love, now, glory of love, now
Glory of love, baby now, baby now, oh baby, glory of love

Don't you tell me
Don't you know
Glory of love, give it to me now, glory of love see you through
Don't you know I'm just a Coney Island baby, now

It might happen to you
Don't you know it might see you through
Baby baby baby baby
Don't you know

Sorry took a while Thank you

"Coney Island Baby"
(_Take No Prisoners_)


When I was a young man in high school
I wanted to play football for the coach, ahh, Freeport Right
Icelit Park, Massive People Park, Rockville Center
The older guys, said he's, he's mean and he's cruel, now
I wanted to play football for the coach
I was little too light weight to go out for line-backer
I wanted to be line-backer
The grass is always greener,
so I went out for right-end
Actually, I was a coldwater, I went out of the section .. eight-six
That's pathetic, big neck
'Cause, some day, man
you gotta stand up straight unless you're gonna fall and
then you're going to die, going to die
And the straightest dude
I ever knew was standing right by me all the time
I had to play football for the coach
And I wanted to play football for the coach
I had to play ball to lose a coach
And I wanted to do it with the coach

When you're all alone and lonely, baby, baby
it's your midnight hour
And you find out that your soul, don't you know, that your soul
is been up for sale

Then you start thinking, ahhh
baby, you're been doin' too much drinkin'
and thinkin' 'bout all the things that you've done
listen to people ... you shouldn't have fun with
Who it was and what it was
and all those things, all those things
you're everything I want, everything you want

Remember the princess on the hill
Ahhh, baby, baby, baby
who loved you knew you was wrong
Remember that love just might come shining through, but

Hey, the glory of our love, ooohhh, sweet nothin'
won't you tell me 'bout the glory of love
Baby, how I miss your love, and I need
the glory of our
it just might see you through
don't you know, it might happen to you

When all your two-bit friends
they've gone and they ripped you right off says everything ...
They say, hey, hey, newly
there's no way you live to be human being
the things they want to say, walkin' in the train

Then you start to thinking, you're doing too much thinking
and they said, said, said
look at, look at all those things that you've done, and I said -
What it was and who it was
and all those things that, baby, everything you want
hey, everything you want

Remember that the city is a funny place
Something like a circus or a sewer
And right now, the city is like a sewer for me, baby

Ah, baby, baby, the glory of 
Yeah the glory of love
I told you the glory of love
baby, everything you do
Don't you know that the glory of love
the glory of love, will see you through
Don't you know about the glory of love and
yeah the glory of love
it just can see you through
baby, ahhh, baby, ahhh, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah the glory of our
Don't you, don't you, don't you, the glory of love
Don't you know that glory of love
might just see you through
baby, baby, you know
It will happen to you
It will ever happen to you
Don't you know, I'm just Coney Island baby, now
Don't you know, I'm just Coney Island baby, now
Don't you know, don't you know

from take no prisoners:

your version:

"When all your two-bit friends they've gone
        and they ripped you right off says everything you ....
        They say, hey hey Lou Reed
        there's no way you'll ever be human being
        The things ...... what they seem
        ah, walkin' in the train"



I think it goes:

"when all your two-bit freinds have gone a ripped you off...
every single one
they say hey hey lou reed,
there's no way you'll live to be human, babe
but things ain't what they seem, I'm walking in a dream..."


---------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------
thanks: Brad Saltzberg (bcsaltzberg@shaw.ca)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

another important correction: from Coney Island Baby TNP:

"Actually, I was a "coldwater",
I went out of the section .. eight-six"


The correct word is "pole vaulter"- as in gymnastics...
then it's

"I went out of the sectionals at 8' 6"
- as in eight feet, six inches

there were still a lot of errors in the lyrics for
"Coney Island steeplechase".
I'm pretty sure I've got it right now,
although there are a couple of lines
that don't make much sense to me
I can't understand that he's saying something else.

The lines that don't make sense
(although I'm 99% sure this is what he's singing) are
"Like summer with ice" and "Don't we would fly"...
On the last one it's possible that he sang wrong,
and then corrected himself, making this a wierd line.
This is quite possible since this song wasn't released
(until "Another view" came along).
It's also possible that he's so fond of ice
that he likes to eat it all summer or something like
that and therefore sings "Like summer with ice".
But, like I said, I think I've got it right this time:



Would you like to go on a Coney Island steeple
Go out and have a good time
We'll take the subway right down to King's Highway
Goin' out and have a good time

It'd be so nice
Like summer with ice
If you come and go with me
The roller-coaster you and me
We'd just fly

Would you like to go on a Coney Island Steeple
Go out and have a good time
Like a sister and brother who cling to each other
When they find out their parents are mad

Oh, it'd be so nice
Like summer with ice
Oh, if you come and go with me
How nice it would be
Don't we would fly

Monday
Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, baby, not Friday
Saturday, oh baby, Sunday
Oh Coney Island, oh Coney Island
Oh Coney Island

Coney Island, Coney Island
Coney Island, Coney Island
Coney Island, Coney Island

        Sit in a theater to see
        A play of hopes and fears
        While the orchestra breathes fitfully
        The music of the spheres

        Mimes, mutter and mumble low
        Mere puppets they, who come and go
        Disguised as gods
        They shift the scenery to and fro
        Inevitably trapped by invisible Wo

        This motley drama
        to be sure
        Will not be forgotten
        A phantom chased for evermore
        Never seized by the crowd
        Through they circle
        Returning to the same spot
        Circle and return to the selfsame spot
        Always to the selfsame spot
        With much of madness and more of sin
        And horror and mimic rout
        The soul of the plot

        Out
        out are the lights
        out all
        And over each dying form
        The curtain, a funeral pall
        Comes with the rush of a storm
        The angels, haggard and wan
        Unveiling and uprising affirm
        That the play is the tragedy, "Man"
        And its hero the Conqueror Worm

written by Lou Reed
==============================


        Somebody took the papers
        and somebody's got the key
        And somebody's nailed the door shut
        and says, hey, what you think that you see

        But me l'm down around the corner
        you know I'm looking for Miss Linda Lee
        Because she's got the power to love me by the hour
        gives me W-L-O-V-E, oh

        Hey baby, if you want it so fast
        don't you know that it ain't gonna last
        Of course you know it makes no difference to me

        Somebody's got the time time
        somebody's got the right
        All of the other people
        trying to use up the night

        But now me, l'm out on the corner
        you know I'm looking for Miss Linda Lee
        Because she's got the power to love me by the hour
        gives me W-L-O-V-E, ooohhh

        Hey, if you want it so fast
        but don't you know honey, you can get it so fast
        But of course you know it makes no difference to me

        Oh oh, you better cool it down
        you know you better cool it down
        You know you better cool it down
        you know you better cool it down

        Oh oh oh, hey, if you want it so fast
        now look it, look baby, don't you want it to last
        But of course you know that
        hey, it makes no difference to me

        Oh oh oh, you better cool it down
        now baby, you better, oh, cool it down
        Don't you know you better cool it down
        you know you better cool it down

"Cool It Down"
(early version)
=====================================
album _Loaded - Fully Loaded Edition_
(The Velvet Underground, 1997)

Apr-Jul 1970
Atlantic Recording Studios, NYC
=====================================


        Somebody's got the papers
        and somebody's got the key
        Somebody nailed the door shut
        and what do you think they'd see

        Down on around the corner
        ah, looking for Miss Linda Lee
        Well she's with a guy that's sweet Jimmy Brown
        and what do you think that they see

        And if you move it fast
        you think that it won't last
        You gonna have to do it
        without me, oh oh ah

        Somebody made the fast call
        somebody yells out twice
        Somebody says, "Hey Henri
        now move your camera, you know it's not nice"

        Somebody's down on the corner
        they're looking for Miss Linda Lee, oh oh now
        Over the bin and the stone again
        but they gotta start without me

        And if they move it so fast
        you think that it won't last
        You know that they going right by me

        Wow, you gotta cool it down
        you gotta cool it down
        You gotta cool it down
        you know you gotta cool, ooohhh, cool down

        (scat)

        Well if you move it fast
        you're sure you want it to last

I've tried the best
I can to update the lyrics for the early version of "Cool it down".
I've corrected some logical errors and filled in the empyt holes.
Here's my corrected version of the text:



Somebody's got the papers
And somebody's got the key
Somebody nailed the door shut
And what you think they'd see

Down on around the corner
Looking for Miss Linda Lee
Well, she's with a guy, that's sweet Jimmy Brown
And what do you think that they see

And if you move it fast, you think that it won't last
You gonna have to do it without me, oh, oh

Somebody made the first call
Somebody yells out twice
Somebody says "Hey, Henry"
Now move your camera, you know it's not nice

Somebody's down on the corner
They're looking for Miss Linda Lee, oh, oh, now
Over the bin and the stone again
But they gotta start without me

And if they move it so fast, you think that it won't last
You know that they going right by me

Wow, you gotta cool it down
You gotta cool it down
You gotta cool it down
You know you gotta cool, oooh, cool down

(scat)

Well, if you move it fast, you're sure you want it to last
You see, that it's all right to me

You know, you better cool it down
you know, you better cool it down
You know, you better cool it down
you know, you better cool it down

"Countess From Hong Kong"
(demo)
==============================
box set _Peel Slowly And See_
(The Velvet Underground, 1995)

written by Lou Reed/John Cale

late 1969
==============================


        Countess from Hong Kong she moves so lightly
        like the summer rain
        And everytime I see and think about her
        it ends up the same
        Walkin' the streets out in Singapore
        it was a funny sight
        But let me say the countess from Hong Kong
        she did everything right

        Countess from Hong Kong
        oh, countess from Hong Kong

        Countess from Hong Kong she moves so lightly
        she's like the summer breeze
        And all of the princes they came from India
        they fell down on their knees
        Silks and satins, what a purple swathe
        she cut among the trees
        The countess from Hong Kong believe me baby
        now you're, ooohhh, like a summer breeze

        Oh, countess from Hong Kong
        Countess from Hong Kong

Here's a minor correction for the lyrics of
"Countess from Hong Kong".
At least I think this is what he's singing:

    Silks and satins, what a purple suede
    she cut among the trees

I noticed in the lyrics for "Countess from Hong Kong",
you have the lyrics as

        "Silks and satins, what a purple suede"

On listening to this,
I think he's saying 'swathe', not suede;
it makes more sense lyrically and grammatically.....

written by Lou Reed
====================



Hop Frog:

        Tomorrow is the seasonal ball
        I propose costumes for you
        and the honourable ministers to wear



King:

        Yes?



Hop Frog:

        All dress as orangutans
        All your guests will run and scream
        with their mouths agape
        And try to hide
        And you, Sire, will have last laugh
        For such imperial cunning



        ---



Hop Frog:

        I will redress the wrong
        I will torture you

        Dead



Tripitena:

        My prince
        My prince
        You light the fire of eternal fame
        Burn, monkeys
        Burn

        Coyote goes to the top of the hill
        doin' the things that coyotes will
        Staring at the sky, at the moon
        you know he starts to howl

        Coyote goes to the mountain top
        looks over down at the river, says what a drop
        No tame dog is gonna take my born

        Coyote at the top of the hill
        doin' the things coyotes will
        You gotta cast the first stone
        cast the first stone

        Jackal goes to the top of the hill
        doin' the things that jackals will
        Staring at the moon
        you know he starts to howl

        Wild dog up on a mountain top
        blood in his jaws, the bone he drops
        No tame dog is ever
        ever gonna take my bone

        Jackal up on the top of the hill
        doin' the things that jackals will

I've filled some gaps.
I changed "standing" for "staring" and some other words,
take a look.
This time the problem isn't english,
i think this time it's the sound,
it's hard to understand even for an english speaker
because of the sound.
But  well, we'll wait for someone to complete it!!



"Coyote"


Coyote goes to the top of the hill
doin' the things the coyote's will
Staring at the sky, at the moon
you know he starts to howl

Coyote goes to the mountain top
look through over down the river sets water drop
No tend dogs is gonna take my bone

Coyote at the top of the hill
doin' the things the coyote's will
You gotta kiss the first stone
kiss the first stone

Jackal goes to the top of the hill
doin' the things the jackal's will
Staring at the moon
you know he starts to howl

Wild dog cope on mountain the top
............ drops
No tend dogs is ever
ever gonna take my bone

Jackal loves on the top of the hill
doin' the things the jackal's will
kiss the first stone
kiss the first stone

Coyote on the top of the hill
ooohhh, doin' the thing the coyote's will
Staring at the sky, looks at the moon
you know he starts to howl

Coyote up on the mountain top
... dogs the bone is drop

Coyote up on the mountain top
... water drops
You gotta kiss the first stone

&gt;Kiss the first stone

I thought the lyric was:
You gotta cast the first stone
Cast the first stone

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes you can use my post on your web site.
I'm sure this is the correct lyric.
It is from the biblical story of Jesus
who told a mob that is about to stone a woman to death.
Jesus told the mob that
"he who is without sin to cast the first stone".
It is kind of appropriate with the current political events
being in the current shape.

Peace,

I'm pretty sure that the line is "no tame dog" not "no tend dog".
Not only does it sound that way (to me anyways),
it also makes more sense.

written by Lou Reed
=========================


        You're the kind of person that I've been dreaming of
        You're the kind of person that I always wanted to love

        And when I first seen you walk right through that bar door
        And I seen those suit 'n' tie Johns buy you one drink
        then buy you some more, I had that -

        I knew you had that crazy feeling
        now now now you've got that, that crazy feeling
        You know that I've had that crazy feeling, too
        I can see it in ya

        You've got that crazy feeling
        now now now now now you've got that, that crazy feeling
        I've had that crazy feeling, too

        Now everybody knows that business ends at three
        And everybody knows an after hours love is free

        And you, you really are a queen
        oh, such a queen, such a queen
        And I know 'cause I've made the same scene
        I know just what you mean because

        You've got that crazy feeling
        now now now you've got that, that crazy feeling now
        You've got that crazy feeling deep inside
        now oh I can see it in your eyes

        You've got that crazy feeling
        now now now you've got that, that crazy feeling
        You've got that crazy feeling, too
        I feel just like ya, feel just like ya

        She lived on a curve of the road
        in an old tar paper shack
        on the south side of the town
        on the wrong side of the tracks

        Sometimes on the way into town
        we'd say, "Mama, can we stop and give her a ride"
        sometimes we did
        but she shocked her and hold hands flew from her side

        Wild eyed, Crazy Mary

        Well down a long dirt road
        past the parson's place
        your old blue car
        we used to race

        The little country store
        with a sign tagged to the side

        Said, "No L-O-I-T-E-R-I-N-G, A, allowed"

        Underneath that sign always congregated
        quite A crowd

        Take a bottle, drink it down
        pass it, hey, pass it all around
        Take a bottle, drink it down
        pass it, pass it all around
        Take a bottle, drink it down
        pass it all around, pass it A, pass it A, around

        One night thunder cracked
        Mercy backed outside my windowsill

        Dreamed I was flying high above the trees and over the hills
        looked down into the house of Mary

        Terrible ponderer
        newspaper covered walls
        and Mary rising up above it all

        Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

        oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh

        Next morning on the way into town
        we saw some skid marks and followed them around
        over the curb
        through the fields into the house of Mary

        That what you fear the most
        could meet you half way
        that what you fear the most
        could meet you half way, yeah

        Take a bottle, drink it down
        pass it A, around
        take a bottle, drink it down
        pass it A, around
        Take a bottle, drink it, drink it down
        pass it A, around, pass it A, pass it A, around

"Cremation - Ashes To Ashes"
============================
album _Magic And Loss_
(Lou Reed, 1992)

written by Lou Reed
============================


        Well the coal-black sea waits for me-me-me
        the coal-black sea waits forever
        The waves hit the shore, crying more-more-more
        but the coal-black sea waits forever

        The tornados come up the coast they run
        hurricanes rip the sky forever
        Through the weathers change, the sea remains the same
        the coal-black sea waits forever

        There are ashes split through collective guilt
        people rest at sea forever
        Since they burnt you up, collect you in a cup
        for you the coal-black sea has no terror

        Will your ashes float like some foreign boat
        or will they sink absorbed forever
        Will the Atlantic Coast, have its final boast
        nothing else contained you ever

        Now the coal-black sea waits for me-me-me
        the coal-black sea waits forever
        When I leave this joint at some further point
        the same coal-black sea will it be waiting

        The waves hit the shore, crying more-more-more
        but the coal-black sea waits forever

        [dialogue in German]

        The tornados come up the coast they run
        hurricanes rip the sky forever
        Through the weathers change, the sea remains the same
        but the coal-black sea waits forever

        There are ashes split through collective guilt
        nothing else contained you ever
        Since they burnt you up, collect you in a cup
        for you the coal-black sea has no terror

        [dialogue in German]

        Will my ashes float like some foreign boat
        or will they sink absorbed forever
        Will the Atlantic Coast, have its final boast
        nothing else contained you ever

        Oh, now the coal-black sea waits for me-me-me
        the coal-black sea waits forever
        When I leave this joint at some further point
        the same coal-black sea will it be waiting

        [dialogue in German]



* chords: same as _Magic And Loss_ version

(Christmas with Cockburn)
=============================================


        Mary grows a child without the help of a man
        Joseph gets upset because he doesn't understand
        Angel comes to Joseph in a powerful dream
        says, "God did this and you're part of his scheme"

        Joseph comes to Mary with his hat in his hand
        Says, "Forgive me, I thought you'd been with some other man"
        She says, "What if I had been
        but I wasn't anyway and guess what
        I felt the baby kick today"

        Like a stone on the surface of a still river
        driving the ripples on forever
        Redemption rips through the surface of time
        in the cry of a tiny babe

        The child is born in the fullness of time
        Three wise astrologers take note of the signs
        Come to pay their respects to the fragile little king
        get pretty close to wrecking everything
        Ooohhh, wrecking everything

        'Cause the governing body of the whole land
        Is that of Herod, a paranoid man
        Who when he hears there's a baby
        born of the King of the Jews
        sends death squads to kill all male children under two
        Children under two
        But that same bright angels warns the parents in a dream
        and they head out for the border and get away clean

        Like a stone on the surface of a still river
        driving the ripples on forever
        Redemption rips through the surface of time
        in the cry of a tiny babe

        And there are others who know about this miracle birth
        The humblest of people catch a glimpse of their worth
        For it isn't to the palace that the Christ child comes
        but to shepherds and street people, hookers and bums

        And the message is clear if you have ears to hear
        That forgiveness is given for your guilt and your fear
        It's a Christmas gift that you don't have to buy
        there's a future shining in a baby's eyes

        Like a stone on the surface of a still river
        driving the ripples on forever
        Redemption rips through the surface of time
        in the cry of a tiny babe

        Like a stone on the surface of a still river
        driving the ripples on forever
        Redemption rips through the surface of time
        in the cry of a tiny babe

Here comes last vers from Cycle Annie rewriten
from SP bootleg Pre-Velvets and 1st vers from So Blue (my work).

I hope it will help a little.


Cycle Annie:

Now little Cycle Annie she has got a guy named Joe
And he trails her around just about everywhere she goes
Now I ain`t saying nothing baby
I ain`t saying that I mind
But when both of them get on that bike
It`s Joe that sits behind
You know, you`d better
Watch out for little Cycle Annie....

"Dark Light"
============================
album _Music From The Elder_
(Kiss, 1981)

written by
Gene Simmons/Ace Frehley/
Anton Fig/Lewis Reed
============================


        Look out, cause there's something wrong
        and you don't know what it is
        Watch out, or it's Sodom and Gommorah
        the malevolent order
        Right now, before it's much too late
        before it's much too late

        A dark light, a darkness never ending
        a dark light, the devil gets his due
        A dark night, is everywhere descending
        a dark light, is coming for you

        Now look up, well the skies are black
        and they're getting darker all the time
        Watch out, for the things that you believe in
        you're gonna be attacked, and you won't know what it is
        Wise up, you better watch your step
        you better watch your step

        A dark light, a darkness never ending
        a dark light, of perversion and hate
        A dark night, is everywhere descending
        a dark light, there's no time to wait

        Look out, for the death of love
        there will be no more love
        Watch out, it's yourself that you are fooling
        who do you think you're fooling
        Shout it out, it's a terrible thing
        such a terrible thing

        A dark light, a darkness never ending
        a dark light, the sun is turning cool
        A dark night, is everywhere descending
        a dark light, is shining at you

        Dark light
        Dark light
        is shining at you
        Dark light

"The Day John Kennedy Died"
===========================
album _The Blue Mask_
(Lou Reed, 1982)

written by Lou Reed
===========================


        I dreamed I was the president
        of these United States
        I dreamed I replaced ignorance
        stupidity and hate
        I dreamed the perfect union
        and a perfect law, undenied
        Most of all I dreamed I forgot
        the day John Kennedy died

        I dreamed that I could do the job
        that others hadn't done
        I dreamed that I was uncorrupt
        and fair to everyone
        I dreamed I wasn't gross or base
        a criminal on the take
        And most of all I dreamed I forgot
        the day John Kennedy died

        Oh, the day John Kennedy died
        Oh, the day John Kennedy died

        I remember where I was that day
        I was upstate in a bar
        The team from the university
        was playing football on TV
        Then the screen went dead and the announcer said
        "There's been a tragedy
        There's are unconfirmed reports the president's been shot
        and he may be dead or dying."

        Talking stopped, someone shouted, "What?!"
        I ran out to the street
        People were gathered everywhere saying
        did you hear what they said on TV
        And then a guy in a Porsche with his radio hit his horn
        and told us the news
        He said "The president's dead
        he was shot twice in the head
        in Dallas, and they don't know by whom."

        I dreamed I was the president
        of these United States
        I dreamed that I was young and smart
        and it was not a waste
        I dreamed that there was a point to life
        and to the human race
        I dreamed that I could somehow comprehend that someone
        shot him in the face

        Oh, the day John Kennedy died
        Oh, the day John Kennedy died
        Oh, the day John Kennedy died
        Oh, the day John Kennedy died

"Dime Store Mystery"
====================
album _New York_
(Lou Reed, 1989)

written by Lou Reed
====================


        He was lying banged and battered, skewered and bleeding
        talking crippled on the cross
        Was his mind reeling and heaving hallucinating
        fleeing what a loss

        The things he hadn't touched or kissed
        his senses slowly stripped away
        Not like Buddha, not like Vishnu
        life wouldn't rise through him again

        I find it easy to believe
        that he might question his beliefs
        The beginning of the last temptation
        dime story mystery

        The duality of nature, godly nature
        human nature splits the soul
        Fully human, fully divine and divided
        the great immortal soul

        Split into pieces, whirling pieces, opposites
        attract
        From the front, the side, the back
        the mind itself attacks

        I know the feeling, I know it from before
        descartes through Hegel belief is never sure
        Dime store mystery
        last temptation

        I was sitting drumming, thinking, thumping, pondering
        the mysteries of life
        Outside the city, shrieking, screaming, whispering
        the mysteries of life

        There's a funeral tomorrow
        at St. Patrick's the bells will ring for you
        Ah, what must you have been thinking
        when you realized the time had come for you

        I wish I hadn't thrown away my time
        on so much human and so much less divine
        The end of the last temptation
        the end of a dime store mystery

"Dirt"
=====================
album _Street Hassle_
(Lou Reed, 1978)

written by Lou Reed
=====================


        It's been a long time since I've spoken to you
        was it the right time
        Your current troubles and you know they'll get much worse
        I hope you know how much you enjoyed them
        You're a pig of a person, there's a justice in this world
        hey, how about that
        Your lack of conscience and your lack of morality
        well more and more people know all about it

        You remember that song by a dude named Bobby Fuller
        It went like this -
        "I fought the law and the law won
        I fought the law and the law won"

        We sat around the other night, me and the guys
        trying to find the right word
        That would best fit and describe
        you and people like it
        That no principle has touched, no principles baptized
        how about that
        Who'd eat shit and say it tasted good
        if there was some money in it for 'em

        Hey, you remember that song by this guy from Texas
        whose name was -
        - Bobby Fuller
        I'll sing it for you, it went like this -
        "I fought the law and the law won
        I fought the law and the law won"

        You're just dirt
        You're just dirt
        the only word for you is dirt
        That's the only word that -

        - Hurt, you're just dirt
        that's all you're worth, cheap-cheap dirt
        You know they call you -
        Cheap-cheap-cheap-cheap uptown dirt
        you're just cheap-cheap-cheap-cheap uptown dirt
        You're just worth, nothing but, cheap uptown dirt
        That's all you're worth, it's just cheap-cheap uptown dirt
        That's all you're worth now
        (cheap-cheap-cheap-cheap uptown dirt)
        You're just dirt
        (cheap-cheap-cheap-cheap uptown dirt)
        (Cheap-cheap-cheap-cheap uptown dirt)
        (cheap-cheap-cheap-cheap uptown dirt)

"Dirty Blvd."
===================
album _New York_
(Lou Reed, 1989)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        Pedro lives out of the Wilshire Hotel
        he looks out a window without glass
        The walls are made of cardboard, newspapers on his feet
        and his father beats him 'cause he's too tired to beg

        He's got 9 brothers and sisters
        they're brought up on their knees
        it's hard to run when a coat hanger beats you on the thighs
        Pedro dreams of being older and killing the old man
        but that's a slim chance he's going to the boulevard

        He's going to end up, on the dirty boulevard
        he's going out, to the dirty boulevard
        He's going down, to the dirty boulevard

        This room cost 2,000 dollars a month
        you can believe it man it's true
        somewhere a landlord's laughing till he wets his pants
        No one dreams of being a doctor or a lawyer or anything
        they dream of dealing on the dirty boulevard

        Give me your hungry, your tired, your poor I'll piss on 'em
        that's what the Statue of Bigotry says
        Your poor huddled masses, let's club 'em to death
        and get it over with and just dump 'em on the boulevard

        Get to end up, on the dirty boulevard
        going out, to the dirty boulevard
        He's going down, on the dirty boulevard
        going out

        Outside it's a bright night
        there's an opera at Lincoln Center
        movie stars arrive by limousine
        The klieg lights shoot up over the skyline of Manhattan
        but the lights are out on the mean streets

        A small kid stands by the Lincoln Tunnel
        he's selling plastic roses for a buck
        The traffic's backed up to 39th Street
        the TV whores are calling the cops out for a suck

        And back at the Wilshire, Pedro sits there dreaming
        he's found a book on magic in a garbage can
        He looks at the pictures and stares at the cracked ceiling
        "At the count of 3," he says, "I hope I can disappear"

        And fly fly away, from this dirty boulevard
        I want to fly, from dirty boulevard
        I want to fly, from dirty boulevard
        I want to fly fly fly fly, from dirty boulevard

        I want to fly away
        I want to fly
        Fly fly away
        I want to fly
        Fly fly away (Fly a-)
        fly fly fly (-way, oh ah...)
        Fly fly away (I want to fly fly away)
        fly away (I want to fly, wow woh, no, fly away)

        He's got 9 brothers and sisters
        they're brought up on their knees
        hard to run when a coat hanger his young thighs
        Pedro dreams of being older and killing the old man
        slim chance he's going to the boulevard

        Get it out
        I'm going down
        Get it out

        This room cost 2,000 dollars a month
        you'd believe it baby, it's true
        somewhere there's a landlord's laughing
        till he wets his pants
        No one dreams of being a doctor or a lawyer or anything
        they just dream of dealing on the boulevard

        Give me your hungry, your tired, your poor I'll piss on 'em
        that's what the Statue of Bigotry says
        Your poor huddled masses
        wanna we just call club 'em to death
        get it over, dump 'em on the boulevard

        Get it out

        Outside it's a bright night
        there's an opera at Lincoln Center
        movie stars arrive by limousine
        The klieg lights shoot up over the Manhattan skyline
        but the lights are out on the mean streets

        Small kid stands by the Lincoln Tunnel
        selling plastic roses for a buck
        Traffic's backed up to 39th Street
        TV whores are calling the cops out get sucked

        Back at the Wilshire, Pedro sits there dreaming
        found a book on magic in a garbage can
        Looks at the pictures, looks at the cracked ceiling
        By the count of 3, baby, I hope I can disappear

        And fly fly away
        I want to fly
        fly away

        Fly fly, fly away
        fly fly, fly away
        Fly fly, fly away
        fly fly, fly away
        Fly away, I want to fly
        fly away, fly away
        Fly fly, fly away
        fly away

The Wiltern, Los Angeles
========================


        Pedro lives out in the Wilshire Hotel
        looks out a window without glass
        The walls are made of cardboard, newspapers on his feet
        the old man beats him 'cause he's too tired to beg

        He's got 9 brothers and sisters
        they're brought up on their knees
        it's hard to run when a coat hanger hits you on the thighs
        Pedro dreams of being older and killing the old father
        but that's a slim chance he's going to the boulevard

        He's get it out, to the dirty boulevard
        I'm going down, to the dirty boulevard
        Get it out, to the dirty boulevard
        going down

        This room cost 5,000 dollars a month
        you believe it baby, it's true
        somewhere a landlord's laughing till he wets his pants
        No one dreams of being a doctor or a lawyer or anything
        they dream of dealing on the boulevard

        Give me your hungry, your tired, your poor I'll piss on 'em

        and dump 'em on the boulevard

        Get it out, the dirty boulevard
        I'm going down, from the dirty boulevard
        Get it out, on the dirty boulevard
        get it down

        Oh, outside it's a bright night
        there's an opera at Lincoln Center
        movie stars arrive by limousine
        The klieg lights shoot up over the Manhattan skyline
        but the lights are out on the mean mean streets

        The lights are out on the mean mean streets
        the lights are out on the mean mean streets, ah
        The lights are out on the mean mean streets
        the lights are out on the mean mean streets

In the lyrics of Dirty Blvd in "Perfect night", you can read

Ever had rasing your heart
ever had some, rasing your heart
Ever had rasing your heart
... ever had rasing your heart


I think that what Lou says is:

You have rage in your heart.
Ever have some rage in your heart
Ever have rage in your heart
Ever have some rage in your heart.

"Don't Hurt A Woman"
====================
album _Mistrial_
(Lou Reed, 1986)

written by Lou Reed
====================


        I was angry, I said things I shouldn't say
        but please don't turn your back
        Sometimes I get so upset
        but I take it all back

        Please don't go, I know I was wrong
        Sometimes I don't know what comes over me

        But I try to remember
        don't hurt a woman
        Don't hurt a woman

        I was angry, I said things I shouldn't say
        I must have lost control
        Sometimes something clicks in my head
        and I'm not myself anymore

        That wasn't me, you can't believe everything you see
        let's make believe I never said a word

        And I'll try to remember
        don't hurt a woman
        Try to remember
        don't hurt a woman
        Try to remember
        don't hurt a woman
        I'll try to remember
        don't hurt a woman
        'Cause I've been lovin' you
        so long

"Don't Talk To Me About Work"
=============================
album _Legendary Hearts_
(Lou Reed, 1983)

written by Lou Reed
=============================


        A perfect day to get out of bed
        shower, dress, shave, kiss you on the head
        Then I hit the office and my head starts to swim

        A perfect day to just walk around
        see a violent movie, check the sounds
        But even on the street
        when I hear a phone ring my heart starts to beat
        when I get home I don't want you to speak

        Don't talk to me about work
        please don't talk to me about work
        I'm up to my eyeballs in dirt
        with work, with work

        How many dollars, how many sales
        how many liars, how many tales
        How many insults must you take in this one life

        I'm in prison most of the day
        so please excuse me if I get this way
        But I have got obligations to keep
        so be very careful when you speak

        Don't talk to me about work
        please don't talk to me about work
        I'm up to my eyeballs in dirt
        with work, with work

        Please don't talk to me about work
        don't you talk to me about work
        I'm up to my eyeballs in dirt
        with work, with work

        Don't talk to me about work
        don't you talk to me about work
        Don't you talk to me about work
        please don't talk to me about work

        Don't you talk to me about work
        please don't talk to me about work
        Don't you talk to me about work

"Don't Try To Find Me"
=======================================
album _No Regrets_
(Jamie Richards, 2002)

written by Anna Lisa Graham/Tony Martin

Lou Reed: background vocals
=======================================


        Girl, I know I'm the farthest thing from your mind
        So I'm headed down the line
        I've lost my dignity
        gotta save my sanity
        So listen girl, whatever you do
        don't try to find me

        At the Holiday Inn in Dallas
        one of L.B.J.
        You can see the sign from the freeway Exit 19A
        At the end of the hall on the top floor
        over lookin' the poll 304
        That's probably where I'm gonna be
        Don't try to find me

        I won't be there long, I'll just pass through
        I'll leave Dallas in a day or two
        Might catch a rodeo
        look up a friend I know
        But after that I'm on the move
        don't try to find me

        At my mama's house in Houston
        just off the Wayside Drive
        At the high school hang a right
        last one on the left hand side
        There's a fence with a rusty old gate
        broken mailbox 108
        That's probably where I'm gonna be
        Don't try to find me

        Don't try to find me
        (try to find me)

        At the Holiday Inn in Dallas
        one off L.B.J.
        You can see the sign from the freeway Exit 19A
        At the end of the hall on the top floor
        over lookin' the poll 304
        If I'm not there I'll probably be

        At my mama's house in Houston
        just off the Wayside Drive
        At the high school hang a right
        last one on the left hand side
        There's a fence with a rusty old gate
        broken mailbox 108
        That's probably where I'm gonna be
        Don't try to find me

"Doin' The Thing That We Want To"
=================================
album _New Sensations_
(Lou Reed, 1984)

written by Lou Reed
=================================


        The other night we went to see Sam's play
        doin' the things that we want to
        It was very physical it held you to the stage
        doin' the things that he wants to

        Doin' the things that he wants to

        The guy's a cowboy from some rodeo
        doin' the things that he wants to
        The girl had once loved him, but now she want to go
        doin' the things that she wants to

        Doin' the things that she wants to

        The man was bullish, the woman was a tease
        doin' the things that they want to
        They fought with their words, their bodies and their deeds
        doin' the things that they want to
        When they finished fighting, they exited the stage
        doin' the things that they want to
        I was firmly struck by the way they had behaved
        doin' the things that they want to

        Doin' the things that they want to
        hey

        It reminds me of the movies Marty made about New York
        (doin' the things that he wants to)
        Those frank and brutal movies that are so brilliant
        (doin' the things that he wants to)
        "True Love (Fool For Love?)" meet "The Raging Bull"
        (doin' the things that he wants to)
        They're very inspirational I love the things they do
        (doin' the things that he wants to)

        Doin' the things that I want to

        There's not much you hear on the radio today
        (doin' the things that we want to)
        But you can still see a movie or a play
        (doin' the things that we want to)
        Here's to Travis Bickle and here's Johnny Boy
        (doin' the things that we want to)
        Growing up in the mean streets of New York
        (doin' the things that we want to)
        I wrote this song 'cause I'd like to shake your hand
        (doin' the things that we want to)
        In a way you guys are the best friends I ever had
        (doin' the things that we want to)

        Doin' the things that we want to

        That we want to
        A true love

        Darling, where
        is there an answer to my question
        Here or there
        you know that I've learned my lesson

        'Cause my love just waits to know
        which way the wind of fortune will blow

        It's up to the one whose love is true
        dominating force, it's your choice

        Meaning who
        is going to be in the next chapter
        Her or you
        you know the words I'm after

        If we awake before it's too late
        we won't have to leave the answer to fate

        It's up to the one whose love is true
        dominating force, it's your choice

        'Cause my love just waits to know
        which way the wind of fortune gonna blow

        It's up to the one whose love is true
        dominating force, it's your choice

        Picking up pieces of information
        down on the docks
        Picking up pieces of information about you
        and how to pick locks
        Scouting around on the Lower East Side
        a mattress is in the rain
        Those uptown ladies with their uptown coats
        come down here to get laid

        It's a boring macho trip
        And I'm the type that fascinates

        Hey, Mrs. Pamela Brown
        how's the Dakota?
        You're 28 years old and your face has been lifted
        but you still look so much older
        Your bed is soiled, your linen is drab
        you got crabs
        The things they sell you, your credit cards
        I love you for 'em
        I love you for it

        I sell you sugar
        I'm a humanitarian
        I give it all to myself that way you're clean
        and I stay out of debt

Picking up pieces of information about you
And how to pick locks
Scouting around on the Lower East Side and matresses in the rain
Them uptown ladies with their uptown coats
Come down here to get laid

It's a boring macho trip
And I'm the type that facinates
Hey, Mrs Pamela Brown, how's the Dakota?

You're twenty eight years and your face has been lifted
But you still look so much older
You been desoiled and your linen is drab,
You've got crabs
The things they sell you
Your credit cards
I love you for it
I love you for it
Sell your sugar
I'm a humanitarian
I give it all to myself
That way you way you cling
And I stay additive

Psychologically it's better that I think that I am dirt

"Dreamin' - Escape"
===============================
album _Magic And Loss_
(Lou Reed, 1992)

written by Lou Reed/Mike Rathke
===============================


        If I close my eyes I see your face
        and I'm not without you
        If I try hard and concentrate
        I can still hear you speak
        I picture myself in your room by the chair
        you're smoking a cigarette
        If I close my eyes I can see your face
        you're saying, "I missed you"

        Dreamin', I'm always dreamin'

        If I close my eyes I can smell your perfume
        you look and say, "Hi babe"
        If I close my eyes pictures from China
        still hang from the wall
        I hear the dog bark I turn and say
        "What were you saying?"
        I picture you in the red chair
        inside the pale room

        Dreamin', I'm always dreamin'

        You sat in your chair with a tube in your arm
        you were so skinny
        You were still making jokes
        I don't know what drugs they had you on
        You said, "I guess this is not the time
        for long term investments"
        You were always laughing
        but you never laughed at me

        They say in the end the pain was so bad
        that you were screaming
        Now you were no saint but you deserved
        better than that
        From the corner I watched them removing things
        from your apartment
        But I can picture your red chair and pale room
        inside my head

        If I close my eyes I see your face
        and I'm not without you
        If I try hard and concentrate I can hear your voice saying
        "Who better than you"
        If I close my eyes I can't believe that
        I'm here without you
        Inside your pale room your empty red chair
        and my head

        Dreamin', I'm always dreamin'
        Dreamin', I'm always dreamin'
        Dreamin', I'm always dreamin'

"Ecstasy"
===================
album _Ecstasy_
(Lou Reed, 2000)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        They call you ecstasy
        nothing ever sticks to you
        Not Velcro, not Scotch Tape
        not my arms dipped in glue

        Not if I wrap myself in nylon
        a piece of duct tape down my back
        Love pierced the arrow with the 12
        and I can't get you back

        Ah, ecstasy
        ecstasy
        Ah, ecstasy

        Across the streets an old Ford, they took off its wheels
        the engine is gone
        In its seat sits a box
        with a note that says, "Goodbye Charlie, thanks a lot"

        I see a child through a window with a bib
        and I think of us and what we almost did
        The Hudson rocketing with light
        the ships pass the Statue of Liberty at night

        They call it ecstasy, ah
        ecstasy
        Ecstasy, ah
        ecstasy

        Some men call me St. Ivory
        some call me St. Maurice
        I'm smooth as alabaster
        with white veins running through my cheeks

        A big stud through my eyebrow
        a scar on my arm that says, "Domain"
        I put it over the tattoo
        that contained your name

        They called you ecstasy, ecstasy
        ecstasy
        They call you ecstasy, ecstasy
        ecstasy

        The moon passing through a cloud
        a body facing up is floating towards a crowd
        And I think of a time and what I couldn't do
        I couldn't hold you close, I couldn't, I couldn't become you

        They call you ecstasy, I can't hold you down
        I can't hold you up
        I feel like that car that I saw today, no radio
        no engine, no hood

        I'm going to the cafe, I hope they've got music
        and I hope that they can play
        But if we have to part
        I'll have a new scar right over my heart
        I'll call it ecstasy

        Oh, ecstasy, ecstasy
        ecstasy
        Ecstasy, ecstasy
        ecstasy

They are the exact words he sings,
not just lyrics I copied from the booklet.



Ecstasy
--------
They call you ecstasy
Nothing ever sticks to you
Not velcro not scotch tape
Not my arms dipped in glue
Not if I wrap myself in nylon
A piece of duct tape down my back
Love pierced the arrow with the 12
And I can't get you back
O ecstasy, ecstacy
O ecstacy

Across the street is an old Ford
They took off its wheels
The engine is gone
In its seat sits a box
with a note that says "goodbye Charlie, thanks a lot"
I see a child through a window with a bib
and I think of us, and what we almost did
The Hudson rocketing with light
The ships pass the Statue of Liberty at night
They call it ecstasy, o, ecstasy
ecstasy, o ecstasy

Some men call me St.Ivory
Some call me St.Maurice
I'm smooth as alabaster
with white veins running through my cheeks
A big stud through my eyebrow
A scar on my arm that says "domain"
I put it over the tattoo
that contained your name
They called you ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy
They call you ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy

The moon passing through a cloud
A body facing up is floating towards a crowd
and I think of a time and what I couldn't do
I couldn't hold you close, I couldn't, I couldn't become you
They call you ecstasy
I can't hold you down, I cant hold you up
I feel like that car that I saw today
No radio, no engine, no hood
I'm going to the cafe I hope they've got music
and I hope that they can play
But if we have to part I'll have a new scar right over my heart
I'll call it ecstasy
O ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy
Ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy

Ecstasy

"Edgar Allan Poe"
===================
album _The Raven_
(Lou Reed, 2003)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        These are the stories of Edgar Allan Poe
        not exactly the boy next door
        He'll tell you tales of horror
        then he'll play with your mind
        if you haven't heard of him
        you must be deaf or blind

        These are the stories of Edgar Allan Poe
        not exactly the boy next door

        He'll tell you about Usher
        whose house burned in his mind
        his love for his dear sister
        her death would drive him wild
        The murder of a stranger
        the murder of a friend
        the callings from the pits of hell
        that never seem to end

        These are the stories of Edgar Allan Poe
        not exactly the boy next door
        These are the stories of Edgar Allan Poe
        not exactly the boy next door

        The diabolic image of the city and the sea
        the chaos and the carnage that reside deep within me
        Decapitations, poisonings, hellish not a bore
        you won't need 3D glasses to pass beyond this door

        Edgar Allan Poe
        not exactly the boy next door

        No Nosferatu Vincent Price or naked women here
        a mind unfurled, a mind unbent is all we have here
        Truth, fried orangutans flutter to the stage
        leave your expectations home
        And listen to the stories of Edgar Allan Poe

        We give you the soliloquy the raven at the door
        flaming pits the moving walls no equilibrium
        No ballast, no bombast
        the unvarnished truth we've got
        mind swoons guilty
        cooking ravings in a pot

        Edgar Allan Poe
        not exactly the boy next door
        Edgar Allan Poe
        not exactly the boy next door

        Tell-tale heart a rotting cask
        a valley of unrest
        a conqueror worm devouring souls
        keep the best for last
        Rings for Annie Lee
        as Poe's buried alive
        regretting his beloved's death in
        all her many guises

        These are the stories of Edgar Allan Poe
        not exactly the, not exactly the boy next door
        Edgar Allan Poe
        not exactly the boy next door
        These are the stories of Edgar Allan Poe
        not exactly the boy next door
        Edgar Allan Poe

"Edgar Allan Poe Intro Song"
========================================
from the play _POEtry_
(Robert Wilson/Lou Reed, 2000)

written by Lou Reed

performed by actors, local musicians (?)

May 09, 2001
Muziek Theater, Amsterdam, Holland
========================================


        These are the stories of Edgar Allan Poe
        not exactly the boy next door
        He'll tell you tales of horror
        then he'll play with your mind
        if you haven't heard of him
        you must be deaf or blind

        These are the stories of Edgar Allan Poe
        not exactly the boy next door

        He'll tell you about Usher
        whose house burned in his mind
        his love for his dear sister
        her death would drive him wild
        The murder of a stranger
        the murder of a friend
        the callings from the pits of hell
        that never seem to end

        These are the stories of Edgar Allan Poe
        not exactly the boy next door
        These are the stories of Edgar Allan Poe
        not exactly the boy next door

        The diabolic image of the city and the sea
        the chaos and the carnage that reside deep within me
        Decapitations, poisonings, though hellish not a bore
        you won't need 3D glasses to pass beyond this door

        These are the stories of Edgar Allan Poe
        not exactly the boy next door

        No Nosferatu Vincent Price or naked women here
        a mind unfurled, a mind unbent is all that we have here
        Truth, fried orangutans flutter to the stage
        leave your expectations home
        And listen to the stories of Edgar Allan Poe

        We give you the soliloquy the raven at the door
        flaming pits the moving walls no equilibrium
        No ballast but no bombast
        the unvarnished truth we've got
        a mind that swoons guilty at night
        cooking ravings in a pot

        These are the stories of Edgar Allan Poe
        not exactly the boy next door
        Oh, Edgar Allan Poe
        not exactly the boy next door

        Tell-tale heart a rotting cask
        a valley of unrest
        a conqueror worm devouring souls
        but keep the best for last
        Bells that ring for Annie Lee
        as Poe's buried alive
        regretting his beloved's death
        in all her many guises

        These are the stories of Edgar Allan Poe
        not exactly the boy next door
        Oh, Edgar Allan Poe
        not exactly the boy next door
        Oh, Edgar Allan Poe
        not exactly the boy next door
        These are the stories of Edgar Allan Poe
        not exactly the boy next door
        Oh, Edgar Allan Poe
        not exactly the boy next door
        These are the stories of Edgar Allan Poe
        Edgar Allan Poe

"Egg Cream"
===========================
album _Blue In The Face_
(Original Soundtrack, 1995)

written by Lou Reed
===========================


        When I was a young man, no bigger than this
        a chocolate Egg Cream was not to be missed
        Some U Bet's Chocolate Syrup, seltzer water mixed with milk
        you stir it up into a heady fro, tasted just like silk

        You scream, I steam, we all want Egg Cream
        You scream, I steam, we all want Egg Cream

        Now you can go to Junior's, Dave's on Canal Street
        and I think there's Ken's in Boston
        there must be something in L.A.
        But Becky's on Kings Highway, was the Egg Cream of choice
        and if you don't believe me, go ask any of the boys

        You scream, I steam, we all want Egg Cream
        You scream, I steam, we all want Egg Cream

        The only good thing I have to say about P.S. 92
        was the Egg Cream served at Becky's, it was a fearsome brew
        For 50 cents you got a shot, choco bubbles up your nose
        that made it easier to deal with knife fights
        and kids pissing in the street

        You scream, I steam, we all want Egg Cream
        You scream, I steam, we all want Egg Cream

        So the next time you're in Brooklyn, please say hello for me
        at Totonno's for pizza and ice cream at Al and Shirley's
        But mostly you go to Becky's, sit in a booth and say hello
        and have two chocolate Egg Creams, one to stay and one to go

        You scream, I steam, we all want Egg Cream, ah
        You scream, I steam, we all want Egg Cream
        You scream, I steam, we all want Egg Cream

"Empty Bottles"
===============================
album _Le Bataclan '72_
(Lou Reed/John Cale/Nico, 2003)

written by John Cale

John Cale: vocal, guitar
Lou Reed: guitar

Jan 29, 1972
Le Bataclan, Paris, France
===============================


        Empty, empty bottles
        Lying side by side
        Used up empty bottles
        Remembering long lost wine

        Keep our empty bottles
        Making empty wine
        Marking our intentions
        Sadly out of time

        And the summer make you lazy
        A day at a time
        And good company evades you
        Passing you by

        But I do love you against all odds
        Though you don't know what I want
        We're much poorer than that bottle
        More foolish than that wine

        Maybe we can make it
        Though we failed before
        You keep getting closer
        Closer to me once more

        And I'll try to entertain you
        A day at a time
        Try to make myself much clearer
        From your wine

        But I do love you against all odds
        Though you don't know what I want
        Seeing you and seeing me
        We're much poorer than that bottle
        More foolish than that wine

"Endless Cycle"
===================
album _New York_
(Lou Reed, 1989)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        The bias of the father runs on through the son
        Leaving him bothered and bewildered
        The drugs in his veins only cause him to spit
        At the face staring back in the mirror

        How can he tell a good act from the bad
        He can't even remember his name
        How can he do what needs to be done
        When he's a follower and not a leader

        The sickness of the mother runs on through the girl
        Leaving her small and helpless
        Liquor flies through her brain with the force of a gun
        Leaving her running in circles

        How can she tell a good act from the bad
        When she's flat on her back in her room
        How can she do what needs to be done
        When she's a coward and a bleeder

        The man if he marries will batter his child
        And have endless excuses
        The woman sadly will do much the same
        Thinking that it's right and it's proper

        Better than their mommy or their daddy did
        Better than the childhood they suffered
        The truth is they're happier when they're in pain
        In fact, that's why they got married

        Pa, pa, pa-pa, pa
        Pa, pa, pa-pa, pa
        Pa, pa, pa-pa, pa
        Pa, pa, pa-pa, pa
        Pa, pa, pa-pa, pa
        Pa, pa, pa-pa, pa

"Endlessly Jealous"
======================
album _New Sensations_
(Lou Reed, 1984)

written by Lou Reed
======================


        Jealousy endlessly
        sweeps through my mind
        Jealousy often causes me to
        be unkind

        I'm sorry I said that
        I'm sorry I did that
        I'm sorry I hit you
        I'm sorry, I'm sorry

        Endlessly jealous of you
        being endlessly jealous of me
        The man that you thought I could be turning red
        with jealousy

        Endlessly jealousy
        eats through my skull
        Endlessly jealousy
        makes me feel dull

        Fighting
        endless jealous fighting
        I feel my fingers tightening
        tightening please don't break her arm

        Jealously thinking of you
        of your endless possession of me
        Of my jealousy, endlessly, jealousy, endlessly
        jealous of you

        Sorry, running to a phone to say
        I'm sorry, running out of dimes
        the phone on the street, spits at me
        have a good day

        Sorry, please you know how I am sorry
        I've been this way for
        Oh, so long, endlessly, zealously
        jealous of you

        Jealousy endlessly
        eats through my mind
        And jealousy endlessly
        makes me be unkind

        I'm sorry I said that
        I'm sorry I did that
        I'm sorry I hit you
        I'm sorry, I'm sorry

        Endlessly jealous of you
        being endlessly jealous of me
        Endlessly jealous of you being endlessly
        jealous of me

        Endlessly jealous of you
        Endlessly jealous of you
        Endlessly jealous of you
        Endlessly jealous of you

    I've been this way for
    Oh, so long, endlessly, zealously
    jealous of you

"Ennui"
=========================
album _Sally Can't Dance_
(Lou Reed, 1974)

written by Lou Reed
=========================


        All the things you said
        you thought I was dead
        everything made me feel aware
        Ah, you're getting old
        you're doing things
        you're losing your hair

        All the things that you used to believe in
        Turned out to be true, you're guilty of reason

        You're the kind of person
        that I could
        do without
        Ah, certain kinds of money
        would make you see
        what it's all about

        There's a first time for everything
        And the first one's on me, don't you see

        All of the things that your old lover said
        well look at them, they jump out of windows
        and now they're just dead
        It's the truth, don't you realize

        They live without any talent or fun
        running out on the streets, balling anyone
        It's the truth, It's the truth

        Pick up the pieces that make up your life
        maybe someday you'll have a wife and then alimony
        Oh, can't you see

        You killed your European Son

        But now your blue clouds have gone
        you'd better say so long, hey hey hey, bye bye bye

        You made your wallpapers green
        you want to make love to the scene
        Your European Son is gone

===================================================
album _The Velvet Underground and Nico - Unripened_
(The Velvet Underground, 2007)
===================================================



        Olivier Landemaine's The VU Web Page says:<em>
        European Son is a longer version
        with a one-minute extra guitar solo after the 'plate break',
        which was probably edited out for the final release.</em>

Looking over the lyrics for European Son,
I believe the phrase
"your clown's bid you" is actually "your cloud's drifted".

album _The Raven_
(Lou Reed, 2003)

written by Lou Reed
========================



King:

        Oh mellifluous dwarf
        prince of all the jesters
        Funny little thing you are
        Make me laugh
        As God's voluminous star



Hop Frog:

        Gracious majesty
        Today is not made for laughter day
        This moment sacred is more for royal sunsets
        Then comic ruin or suicidal jests



King:

        I'll be the judge of that thank you
        Make me laugh le petite cur
        Drink some wine
        Lest you foul sweet time



Hop Frog:

        Drink upsets me
        please your liege
        This would mark the death me



King:

        I said drink you scabrous whore
        Are you deaf as well as short?



Tripitena:

        Kingdom's Sire
        big as you are
        Save such
        bile for larger foes



King:

        Make me laugh
        'Fore I stretch your neck like a giraffe

"Faces And Names"
=============================
album _Songs For Drella_
(Lou Reed/John Cale, 1990)

written by Lou Reed/John Cale

sung by John Cale
=============================


        Faces and names, I wish they were the same
        faces and names only cause trouble for me
        Faces and names

        If we all looked the same and we all had the same name
        I wouldn't be jealous of you or you jealous of me
        Faces and names

        I always fall in love with someone who looks
        the way I wish that I could be
        I'm always staring at someone who hurts
        and the one they hurt is me

        Faces and names, to me they're all the same
        if I looked like you and you looked like me
        There'd be less trouble you'd see

        Faces and names, I wish they'd go away
        I'd disappear into that wall and never talk
        Talk not talk

        I wish I was a robot or a machine
        without a feeling or a thought
        People who want to meet the name I have
        are always disappointed in me

        Faces and names, I wish they were the same
        faces and names only cause problems for me
        Faces and names

        I'd rather be a hole in the wall
        looking on the other side
        I'd rather look and listen, listen not talk
        To faces and names

        If I had a breakdown when I was a kid
        if I lost my hair when I was young
        If you dress older when you are not
        as you really age, you look the same

        If we all looked the same, we wouldn't play these games
        me dressing for you, you dressing for me
        Undressing for me

        Faces and names, if they all were the same
        you wouldn't be jealous of me or me jealous of you
        Me jealous of you, you jealous of you

        Your face and your name

"The Fall Of The House Of Usher"
================================
album _The Raven_
(Lou Reed, 2003)

written by Lou Reed
================================



Edgar:

        And then I had a vision



Roderick Usher:

        Ah Edgar
        Ah Edgar, my dear friend Edgar



Edgar:

        It's been a long time, Roderick
        I've ridden many miles
        It's been a dull and soundless day for autumn
        The leaves have lost their autumn glow
        and the clouds seem oppressive with their drifting finery



Roderick Usher:

        I know, my friend
        Though I own so much of this land I find
        the country insufferable
        I deal only in half pleasures



Edgar:

        Speaking of half pleasures
        would you care for a tincture of opium?



Roderick Usher:

        Nothing would please me more than to smoke
        with an old friend

        I've experienced the hideous dropping of the veil
        the bitter lapse into common life
        unredeemed dreariness of thought
        I have an iciness, a sickening of the heart



Edgar:

        It's true you don't look well, Roderick
        but I am your friend
        no matter the occasion or position of the stars
        I'm glad you wrote me
        but I must admit to concern



Roderick Usher:

        I cannot contain my heart
        Edgar, I look to you for solace
        for relief from myself
        What I have is constitutional
        a family evil, a nervous affection that must surely pass
        But I do have this morbid acuteness of senses
        I can eat only the most insipid food
        clothes only of the lightest texture
        The odor of flowers I find oppressive
        My eyes cannot bear even the faintest light



Madeline Usher:

        [moaning]



Roderick Usher:

        Did you hear that?



Edgar:

        I hear
        I am listening, go on



Roderick Usher:

        I shall perish
        I will perish in this deplorable folly
        I dread the future
        Not the events, the results
        The most trivial event
        causes the greatest agitation of the soul
        I do not fear danger except in its absolute effect
        terror
        I find I must inevitably abandon life and reason together
        in my struggles with the demon fear

        Perhaps you'll think me superstitious
        but the physique of this place
        it hovers about me like a great body
        some diseased outer shell
        some decaying finite skin encasing my morale



Edgar:

        You mentioned your sister was ill



Roderick Usher:

        My beloved sister, my sole companion
        has had a long continuing illness
        whose inevitable conclusion seems forsworn
        This will leave me the last of the ancient race of Ushers



Madeline Usher:

        [moaning]



Edgar:

        She looks so much like you



Roderick Usher:

        I love her in a nameless way
        more than I love myself
        Her demise will leave me hopelessly
        confined to memories and realities of a future
        so barren as to be stultifying



Madeline Usher:

        [moaning]



Edgar:

        Oh, what of physicians?



Roderick Usher:

        Ah, they are baffled
        Until today she refused bed rest
        wanting to be present in your honor
        but finally she succumbed to the prostrating power
        of the destroyer
        You will probably see her no more



Edgar:

        Sound and music take us to the twin curves of experience
        Like brother and sister intertwined
        they relieve themselves of bodily contact
        and dance in a pagan revelry



Roderick Usher:

        I have soiled myself with my designs
        I am ashamed of my brain
        The enemy is me
        and the executioner terror
        Music is a reflection of our inner self
        unfiltered agony touches the wayward string
        The wayward brain confuses itself
        with the self-perceived future
        and turns inward with loathing and terror
        Either by design or thought
        we are doomed to know our own end
        I've written a lyric



Edgar:

        May I hear it?



Roderick Usher:

        It is called "The Haunted Palace"


        In the greenest of our valleys,
        By good angels tenanted,
        Once a fair and stately palace --
        Snow-white palace -- reared its head.

        Banners yellow, glorious, golden,
        On its roof did float and flow;
        (This -- all this -- was in the olden
        Time long ago)
        And every gentle air that dallied,
        Along the rampart plumed and pallid,
        A winged odor went away.

        All wanderers in that happy valley
        Through two luminous windows saw
        Spirits moving musically
        The sovereign of the realm serene,
        A troop of echoes whose sweet duty
        Was but to sing
        In voices of surpassing beauty,
        The wit and wisdom of their king.

        But evil things in robes of sorrow,
        Assailed the monarch's high estate!
        And round about his home the glory,
        Is but a dim-remembered story.

        Vast forms that move fantastically
        To a discordant melody;
        While, like a ghastly river,
        A hideous throng rush out forever,
        And laugh -- but smile no more.

        Nevermore.



Edgar:

        It's cold in here



Roderick Usher:

        I tell you minerals are sentient things
        The gradual yet certain condensation of an atmosphere
        of their own about the waters and the walls proves this
        Thus the silent yet importunate and terrible influence
        which for centuries has molded my family
        And now me



Madeline Usher:

        [screaming]



Roderick Usher:

        Excuse me



Madeline Usher:

        [vomiting]



Roderick Usher:

        She is gone
        Out, sad light
        Roderick has no life

        I shall preserve her corpse for a fortnight



Edgar:

        But Roderick..



Roderick Usher:

        I shall place it in a vault facing the lake
        I do not wish to answer to the medical men
        nor place her in the exposed burial plot of my family
        We shall inter her at the proper date
        when I am more fully of a right mind
        Her malady was unusual
        Please do not question me on this



Edgar:

        I cannot question you



Roderick Usher:

        Then help me now



Madeline Usher:

        [moaning]



Edgar:

        One would think you twins



Roderick Usher:

        We are
        We have always been sympathetic to each other
        Have you seen this?
        It is her



Edgar:

        It is a whirlwind
        You should not
        you must not behold this

        Roderick, these appearances
        which bewilder you are mere electrical phenomena
        not uncommon
        Or perhaps they have their rank origins
        in the marshy gases of the lake
        Please, let's close this casement
        and I will read and you will listen
        and together we will pass this terrible night together

        What's that?
        What is that?
        Don't you hear that?



Roderick Usher:

        Not hear it?
        Yes, I hear it and have heard it many minutes
        have I heard it?
        Oh, pity me miserable wretch
        I dared not
        Oh no
        I dared not speak
        We have put her living in the tomb
        I have heard feeble movements in the coffin
        I thought I heard
        I dared not speak
        Oh God
        I have heard footsteps
        Do you not hear them?
        Attention
        Do I not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating
        of her heart?
        Madman
        Madman
        I tell you she now stands without the door

Here I give you a nearly complete transcription of
The Fall Of The House Of Usher.
The missing words I marked with $..$. Post it on your site

Here it comes, enjoy:

Lou Reed - The Fall Of The House Of Usher


Edgar (left): And then I had a vision.

Roderick (right): Ah Edgar. Ah Edgar, my dear friend Edgar.

e. It's been a long time, Roderick. I've ridden many miles.
It's been a dull and soundless day for autumn.
The leaves have lost their autumn low
and the clouds seem oppressive with their drifting finery.

r. I know, my friend.
Though I own so much of this land I find the country insufferable.
I deal only in half-pleasures.

e. Speaking of half-pleasure.
Would you care for a tincture of opium?

r. Nothing would please me more than to smoke with an old friend.

r. I've experienced the hideous dropping of the vale.
The bitter lapse into common life.
Unredeemed dreariness of thought I have and iciness,
a sickening of the heart.

e. It's true, you don't look well, Roderick. But,
I am your friend no matter the occasion or position of the stars.
I'm glad you wrote me, but, I must admit to concern.

r. I cannot contain my heart.
Edgar, I look to you for solace, for relief from myself.
But I have this constitution, a family evil,
a nervous affection that must surely pass.
But, I do have this morbid acuteness of senses.
I can eat only the most insipid food,
clothes only of the lightest texture,
the odour of flowers I find oppressive.
My eyes cannot bear even the faintest light.

r. Did you hear that?

e. I hear. I am listening. Go on.

r. I shall perish. I will perish in this deplorable folly.
I dread the future. Not the events, the results.
The most trivial event causes the greatest agitation of the soul.
I do not fear danger except in its absolute affect: terror.
I find I must inevitably abandon life
and reason together in my struggles with the demon fear.
Perhaps you'll think me superstitous
but the physique of this place
that hovers above me like a great body, some disease, outer shell,
some decaying, finite skin, encasing my morale.

e. You'd mentioned your sister was ill.

r. My beloved sister, my soul companion,
has had a long continuing illness
whose inevitable conclusion seems forsworn.
This will leave me the last of the ancient race of Ushers.

e. She looks so much like you.

r. I love her in a nameless way, more than I love myself.
Her demise will leave me hopelessly confined in memories
and realities of a future so barren as to be stultifying.

e. What of physicians?

r. They are baffled. Until today she refused bedrest.
Wanting to be present in your honour
but finally she's come to the prostrating power of the destroyer.
You'll probably see her no more.

e. Sound and music take us to the twin curves of experience.
Like brother and sister intertwined
they relieve themselves of bodily contact
and dance in a pagan reverie.

r. I have soiled myself with my designs. I'm ashamed of my brain.
The enemy is me. And the execution of terror.
Music is a reflection of our inner self.
Unfiltered agony touches the wayward string.
The wayward brain confuses itself with the self-perceived future
and turns inward with loathing and terror.
Either by design or thought, we are doomed to know our own end.
I've written a lyric.

e. May I hear it?

r. It is called the Haunted Palace
In the greenest of our valleys, by good angels tenanted
Once a fair and stately palace, a snowwhite palace, reared its head.
Banners yellow, glorious, golden on its roof did float and flow
This - all this - was in the olden time long ago.

And every gentle air that dallied
along the rampart plumed and pallid
A winged odour went away
All wanderers in that happy valley through two luminous windows
Saw spirits moving musically
The sovereign of the realm $...$
A troop of echoes whose sweet duty was but to sing in voices
Of surpassing beauty
The wit and wisdom of the king

But evil things in robes of sorrow
Assailed the monarch's high estate
And round about his home the glory is
But a dim-remembered story

Vast forms that move fantastically
To a discordant melody
While, like a ghastly river, a hideous throng
Rush out forever and laugh
But smile no more
Nevermore


e. It's cold in here.

r. I tell you minerals are sentient things.
The gradual yet certain condensation of an atmosphere
of their own about the waters in the walls proofs this.
Thus the silent yes importunate and terrible influence
which for centuries has moulded my family. And now me. Excuse me.

r. She has gone. Out sad light. Roderick has no life.
I shall preserve her corpse for a fortnight.

e. Roderick.

r. I shall place it in a vault facing the lake.
I don't wish $...$ medical men
nor place her in the exposed burial plot of my family.
We shall inter her at the proper date
when I am more fully of a right mind. Her malady was unusual.
Please do not question me on this.

e. I cannot question you.

r. Then help me now.

e. Huh, one would think you're twins.

r. We are. We have always been sympathetic to each other.
Have you seen this? It is her.

e. It is a whirlwind. You should not, you must not behold this!
Roderick, these appearences which bewilder
you are mere electrical phenomena not uncommon.
Or perhaps they have their rank origins
in the marshy gases of the lake.
Please, let's close this casement
and I will read and you will listen
and together we will pass this terrible night together.
What's that? What is that? Don't your hear that?

r. Not hear it. Yes, I hear it. And I've heard it many minutes.
Have I heard it? Oh pity me - miserable wretch. I dared not.
Oh no. I dared not speak. We have put her living in the tomb.
I've heard feeble movements in the coffin. I thought I heard.
I dared not speak. Oh god. I heard footsteps. Do you not hear them?
Attention. Do I not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating
of her heart? Madman. Madman.
I tell you, she now stands without the door!

"Families"
================================
album _The Bells_
(Lou Reed, 1979)

written by Lou Reed/Ellard Boles
================================


        (How's the family)
        (How's the family)

        Mama, you tell me how's the family
        And mama, tell me how's things going by you
        And little baby sister, I heard that you got married
        And I heard that you had yourself a little baby girl, too
        And here's some uncles and some cousins I know vaguely
        And would you believe my old dog Chelsy's there, too
        And would you believe nobody in this family
        wanted to keep her
        And now that dog's more a part of this family
        than I am too
        I don't come home much anymore
        No no no I don't come home much anymore
        Mama

        And mama, I know how disappointed you are
        And papa, I know that you feel the same way too
        And no no no no no I still haven't got married
        And no no no there's no grandson planned here for you
        And by the way daddy tell me how's the business
        I understand that your stock she's growing very high
        No daddy, you're not a poor man anymore
        And I hope you realize that before you die
        Because I don't come home much anymore
        No no no no no I don't come home much no more
        But daddy

        And please please please please please
        come on let's not start this business again
        I know how much you resent the life that I have
        But one more time I don't want the family business
        Don't want to inherit it upon the day that you die
        Really dad, you should have given it to my sister
        You know Elizabeth, you know Elizabeth
        she has a better head for those things than I
        She lives practically around the corner
        That's really the kind of child you could be proud of
        But papa, I know that this visit's a mistake
        There's nothing here we have in common except our name
        And families that live out in the suburbs
        Often make each other cry
        And I don't think that I'll come home much anymore
        No no I don't think I'll come home much again
        Mama
        Papa
        Families
        Often make each other cry
        No I don't think that I'll come home much anymore

"Femme Fatale"
=======================================
album _The Velvet Underground and Nico_
(The Velvet Underground, 1967)

written by Lou Reed
=======================================


        Here she comes
        you'd better watch your step
        She's going to break your heart in two
        it's true

        It's not hard to realize
        just look into her false colored eyes
        She'll build you up to just put you down
        what a clown

        'Cause everybody knows
        (she's a femme fatale)
        the things she does to please
        (she's a femme fatale)
        She's just a little tease
        (she's a femme fatale)
        See the way she walks
        hear the way she talks

        You're written in her book
        you're number 37, have a look
        She's going to smile to make you frown
        what a clown

        Little boy, she's from the street
        before you start you're already beat
        She's going to play you for a fool
        yes it's true

        'Cause everybody knows
        (she's a femme fatale)
        the things she does to please
        (she's a femme fatale)
        She's just a little tease
        (she's a femme fatale)
        See the way she walks
        hear the way she talks

        'Cause everybody knows
        (she's a femme fatale)
        the things she does to please
        (she's a femme fatale)
        She's just a little tease
        (she's a femme fatale)
        Oh wow woh
        (she's a femme fatale)
        oh wow woh
        (she's a femme fatale)
        Oh wow woh
        (she's a femme fatale)
        oh wow woh
        (she's a femme fatale)

=================================


        Here she comes
        you'd better watch your step
        She's going to break your heart in two
        yes, it's true

        (she's a femme fatale)
        She's just a little tease

        before you start you're already beat
        She's going to play you for a fool
        yes it's true

        'Cause everybody knows
        (she's a femme fatale)
        the things she does to please
        (she's a femme fatale)
        She's just a little tease
        (she's a femme fatale)
        See the way she walks
        hear the way she talks

        'Cause everybody knows
        (she's a femme fatale)
        (she's a femme fatale)
        (She's a femme fatale)
        oh wow woh
        (she's a femme fatale)
        Oh wow woh
        (she's a femme fatale)
        oh wow woh
        (she's a femme fatale)

"Finish Line"
================================
album _Set The Twilight Reeling_
(Lou Reed, 1996)

written by Lou Reed
================================


        Wind blows snow outside my window
        crowd below runs wild in the streets
        Two rented brothers race down two separate alleys
        heading for the finish line

        Down in the train yard out by the stockyard
        butchers with aprons hack meat in the snow
        Blood has the brothers pulsing with envy
        heading for the finish line

        Two rented brothers, faces keep changing
        like these feelings that I have for you
        Nothing's forever not even five minutes
        when you're headed for the finish line

        Down by the depot out by the meat rack
        ah, down by the tunnels surrounding the jail
        Prisoners are marching in squares and in circles
        they're heading for the finish line

        They're lining up for Noah's Ark
        they're stabbing each other in the dark
        Saluting a flag made of some rich guy's socks
        heading for the finish line

        Close to the line the ice is cracking
        two rented feelings sitting in the stands
        Two mothers, two fathers and both of them are paid for
        all of a sudden it comes back to me

        Just up ahead is the finish line
        two rented referees and two checkered rags
        Out of the corner of my eye comes
        a dark horse with black wings
        ooohhh, headed for the finish line

        I'm five years old the room is fuzzy
        I think there's also a very young girl
        It's hard to remember what happened exactly
        as I'm staring at the finish line

        Ooohhh, first came fire then came light
        then came feeling then came sight

"Fired Up"
============================================
album _I Spent A Week There The Other Night_
(Moe Tucker, 1991)

written by Moe Tucker

Lou Reed: lead guitar
============================================


        I'm fired up, pissed off
        I'm tired and I'm mad

        I work hard, get nowhere
        lousy job and no one cares

        Drugs and crime, flashin' knives
        violent people, wasted lives

        Go away and don't stop
        don't knock, the door's locked

        High price won't pay
        worry worry every day

        Homeless families in the streets
        no one help them on their feet

        They can't read, they can't spell
        what about welfare, what the hell

        Close the door and lock it tight
        hit the floor, keep from sight

        Drug dealers gettin' richer
        drug babies havin' seizures

        You and me, what I see
        living life is when we're free

        I'm fired up, pissed off
        I'm tired and I'm mad
        I'm fired up, pissed off
        I'm tired and I'm mad
        Fired up, pissed off
        I'm tired and I'm mad

        Go away and don't stop
        don't knock, the door's locked

"Fired Up"

I'm fired up, pissed off
I'm tired and I'm mad
I work hard, get nowhere
Lousy job and no one cares
Drugs and crime, flashin' knives
Violent people, wasted lives

Go away and don't stop
Don't knock, the door's locked

High price won't pay
Worry worry every day
Homeless families in the streets
No one help them on their feet
They can't read, they can't spell
What about welfare, what the hell

Close the door and lock it tight
Hit the floor, keep from sight

Drug dealers gettin' richer
Drug babies havin' seizures
You and me, what I see
Living life is when we're free

I'm fired up, pissed off
I'm tired and I'm mad
I'm fired up, pissed off
I'm tired and I'm mad
I'm fired up, pissed off
I'm tired and I'm mad.

Go away and don't stop
Don't knock, the door's locked

Lou Reed/Terry Philips/Jerry Vance/Jimmie Sims

performed by The Hi-Lifes
==============================================


        I met her tonight
        for the very first time
        She was a living doll
        and she drove me wild

        She stole my heart
        from the very start
        But I wonder
        what she thinks of me

        First impression
        would she like me
        First impression
        what would she think

        We took a walk
        and we had a talk
        She said that she
        love him go and study

        I asked if I
        can see you sometime
        And then she turned around
        and she smiled at me

        First impression
        would she like me
        First impression
        what would she think
        What would she think
        tell me what would she think
        I want to know what would she think
        somebody tell me what would she think
        what would she think

"First Impression"


I met her tonight
for the very first time
She was ...
and she drove me...
She's though my heart from the very start
but i wonder, what she thinks of me?
First impresion
would she like me?
First impression
what would she think?
We took a walk
and we had a talk
She said that she...
I asked if i could see you sometime
and then she turned around
and she smiled at me
First impression
would she like me?
First impression
what would she think? 
(fade out)

---------------------------------------------------------------------

I send you a lyrics update for the pre-velvet songs.
i paid attention and i could fill more gaps,
i could complete some more gaps.


first impression


I asked if i could see you

===============================


        I was lying in my bed last night
        staring at a ceiling full of stars
        When it suddenly hit me
        I just have to let you know how I feel

        We live together
        in a photograph of time
        Now I look into your eyes
        and the seas open up to me
        I tell you I love you
        and I always will
        Now I know
        you can't tell me
        I know
        ... you can't tell me

        So I'm left to pick up the hints
        the little symbols of your devotion
        So I'm left to pick up the hints
        the little symbols of your devotion

        And I feel your fist
        and I know it's out of love
        And I feel the whip
        and I know it's out of love
        And I feel your burning eyes
        oh, burning holes, straight through my heart

        It's out of love, ooohhh
        it's out of love

        And I accept and I collect upon my body
        the memories of your devotion
        Now I accept, now I collect upon my body
        the memories of your devotion, ooohhh

        Now I feel your fist
        and I know it's out of love
        And I feel the whip
        and I know it's out of love
        And I feel your burning eyes
        burning holes, straight through my heart

        It's out of love, ooohhh
        it's out of love, oh

        Give me a little serious love
        give me a little fistful of love
        Fistful of love, wow bon bon wow
        Fist, fist, fist
        fistful of love, ooohhh darling, wow wow wow
        You give me a little bit
        give me a little fistful of love
        ooohhh, ooohhh, ooohhh
        Give me, ooohhh, give me
        fistful of love
        Ooohhh, give me a little
        give me a little
        give me fistful of love
        give a little bit, give a little bit of fistful of love
        Ooohhh, ooohhh baby
        give me a little bit of fistful of love

        Ooohhh, little ....

        Give me little, little bit
        give me little, little bit

"Fly Into The Sun"
======================
album _New Sensations_
(Lou Reed, 1984)

written by Lou Reed
======================


        I would not run from the Holocaust
        I would not run from the bomb
        I'd welcome the chance to meet my maker
        and fly into the sun

        Fly into the sun
        fly into the sun
        I'd break up into million pieces
        and fly into the sun

        I would not run from the blazing light
        I would not run from its rain
        I'd see it as an end to misery
        as an end to worldly pain

        An end to worldly pain
        an end to worldly pain
        I'd shine by the light of the unknown moment
        to end this worldly pain

        And fly into the sun
        fly into the sun
        I'd shine by the light of the unknown moment
        and fly into the sun

        The earth is weeping, the sky is shaking
        the stars split to their core
        And every proton and unnamed neutron
        is fusing in my bones

        And an unnamed mammal is darkly rising
        as man burns from his tomb
        And I look at this as a blissful moment
        to fly into the sun

        Fly into the sun
        fly into the sun
        I'd burn up into a million pieces
        and fly into the sun

        To end this mystery
        answer my mystery
        I'd look at this as a wondrous moment
        to end this mystery

        Fly into the sun
        fly into the sun
        I'd break up into a million pieces
        and fly into the sun

        He's over by the corner
        got her hands by her side, ah
        Then hit her harder-harder-harder, ooohhh
        till they thought she might die

        Well I got a foggy notion, do it again
        oh, over by the corner, do it again
        I got my calamine lotion, baby, do it again
        well I got a foggy notion, do it again

        I'll do something that I never did before
        I'll first track down to a flower store
        I bought her a bundle, a beautiful batch
        don't you know something, she sent it right back, alright

        She made me do something that I never did before
        I rushed right out to a flower store
        I bought her a bundle, a beautiful batch
        don't you know something, she sent it right back

        Sally Mae, Sally Mae
        Sally Mae, oh darling, Sally Mae, yeah
        Sally Mae, Sally Mae
        Sally Mae, oh no, Sally Mae, alright

        Well she's over by the corner
        got her hands by her side
        Then hit it harder-harder-harder
        ooohhh, till they thought she might die

        Well I got a foggy notion, do it again
        over in the corner, do it again
        I got my calamine lotion, do it again
        well I got a foggy notion, do it again

We are discussing Foggy Notion on the list this week.
And the General opinion seems to be that
"Selling Me" is actually "Sally Mae".
I am not sure why they are spelling Mae and Not "May" though.

The line is "I bought her a bundle, a beautiful batch"
And yes it is Sally Mae
(this is just how the name is generally spelt in the US)

"Foot Of Pride"
================================================
album _The 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration_
(Bob Dylan, 1993)

written by Bob Dylan

Lou Reed: guitar, vocals

Oct 16, 1992
Madison Square Garden, NYC
================================================


        Like the lion wrest the flesh off of a man
        so can a woman who passes herself off as a male
        They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer
        preacher talking 'bout Christ betrayed
        Like the earth just opened and swallowed him up
        reached too high, was thrown back to the ground
        You know what they say about bein' nice

I've filled in some blanks and corrected some mistakes
in the lyrics for Reed's version of Dylan's "Foot of Pride":



Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man
so can a woman who passes herself off as a male
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer
preacher talking 'bout Christ betrayed
Like the earth just opened and swallowed him up
reached too high, was thrown back to the ground
You know what they say about bein' nice to the right people
        on the way up
sooner or later you gonna meet them on the way down

Oh, there ain't no comin' back
when the foot of pride come down
ain't no comin' back
Oh no, comin' back
when the foot of pride come down
ye ain't comin' back

They got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names
sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed
He looked straight into the sun and said "Revenge is mine"
but he drinks and drinks can be fixed
Sing me one more song, hah, about your love to the moon
        and the stranger
and your fall by the sword love affair with Erroll Flynn
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in

Oh, there ain't no comin' back
when the foot of pride
come down, hey-hey-hey-hey
Woh baby, ain't no comin' back
the foot of pride comes down, hey-hey-hey
hey, ain't no comin' back

There's a businessman named Red cast-a
cast down from heaven and he's out of his head-a
Feeds off of everyone that he can touch
he said he only deals in cash or sells tickets to a plane crash
Not somebody you play around with much, Miss Delilah is his,
        a Philistine is what she is
She'll do wondrous works with your fate
Ah, feed you coconut bread, spice buns in bed
If you don't mind sleepin' with your head faced down in a grave

Oh, ain't comin' back
the foot of pride come down
baby hey-hey, ain't no comin' back
Oh-oh, there, hey-hey, there ain't no comin' back
when the foot of pride come down
oh, woh, ain't no comin' back

Oh well, they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight
you'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors
How to enter the gates of paradise
No! How to carry a burden too heavy to be yours
Yeah, from the stage they'll be tryin' to get water outta rocks
A whore will pass the hat,
        collect a hundred grand and say "Hey, hey, hey thanks!"
They like to take all this money from sin,
        build big universities to study in
sing "Amazing Grace" all the way to the Swiss banks

Oh, foot of pride come down
You ain't comin' back, ah-hah-hah

Ooohhh, ain't comin' back
the foot of pride
ain't no comin' back
Ain't no comin' back
when the foot of pride
ain't, ain't no comin' back

Yeah, I guess I loved him too
I can still see him in my mind climbin' that hill

        let the dead bury the dead, your time will come
Let hot iron blow as he raised, raised his shade

Oh baby-baby, ain't no comin' back
the foot of pride come down
oh, oh, oh, oh, ain't no comin' back
Oh-oh-oh, ain't no comin' back, you know that
foot-foot-foot of pride come down

Oh, ain't no comin' back
ain't no comin' back
oh, ain't no comin' back, baby
oh no-no, ain't no comin' back

"Forever Changed"
=============================
album _Songs For Drella_
(Lou Reed/John Cale, 1990)

written by Lou Reed/John Cale

sung by John Cale
=============================


        Train entering the city
        I lost myself and never came back
        Took a trip 'round the world and never came back
        Black silhouettes, crisscrossed tracks, never came back

        Forever changed
        Forever changed

        You might think I'm frivolous, uncaring and cold
        You might think I'm empty, depends on your point of view
        Society Andy who paints and records them
        The high and the low, never turn back

        Forever changed
        Forever changed
        Forever changed
        Forever changed

        Got to get to the city, get a job
        Got to get some work to see me through
        My old life's behind, I see it receding
        My life's disappearing, disappearing from view

        Hong Kong and I was changed
        Burma, Thailand and I was changed
        A few good friends to see me through
        Henry and Brigid to see me through
        Only art to see me through
        Only heart to see me through
        My old life's disappearing, disappearing from view

        Forever changed
        Forever changed
        I was forever changed

"Future Farmers Of America"
===========================================
album _Ecstasy_
(Lou Reed, 2000)

written by Lou Reed

* written for the play _Time Rocker_ (1996)
===========================================


        Born on a farm in a transatlantic moonlight
        split like a cord of wood my family broke up
        Sold like a piece of steer, a piece of meat, a cow
        a breathing piece of shit

        Picked for my age, for my strength and make up
        called for I was tall, I was big, I could hold up
        A tree or a piece of steel I could do
        what my fat owner can't

        Ah, future farmers of America
        future farmers of America
        Future farmers of America

        Ah
        I'm always watching the way his wife looks me over
        I have a sex twice as big as her husband's
        If I wasn't so large, so strong, so pale
        I'd disappear under a bush

        Colorless men and ladies of the world unite
        kill your master with one cut of your knife
        Kill them during sex, kill them during talk
        kill them whenever you can

        Future farmers of America
        future farmers of America
        Future farmers of America

        These -
        - stupid black owners are foreigners to affairs of the heart
        look at me, I'll never own land that I work on
        Every one of us here shares a surname
        this father must die

        I was born on the dark cusp of twilight
        my father was dark, my mother was light
        Look at me, I'm strong
        I could crush him in my fist

        Ah
        I could crush him in my
        I could crush him in my
        I could crush him in my fist

        I could crush him in my
        I could crush him in my
        I could crush him in my fist

        Future farmers of America
        I could crush him in my fist
        Future farmers of America
        I could crush him in my fist
        Future farmers of America
        I could crush him in my fist

"Future Farmers Of America"
==============================================
from the play _Time Rocker_
(Robert Wilson/Darryl Pinckney/Lou Reed, 1996)

performed by actors, German musicians

Jun 11, 1996
Thalia Theater, Hamburg, Germany
(pre-premiere)
==============================================


        Born on a farm in a transatlantic moonlight
        split like a cord of wood my family broke up
        Sold like a piece of steer, a piece of meat, a cow
        a breathing piece of shit

        Picked for my age, for my strength and make up
        called for I was tall, I was big, I could hold up
        A tree or a piece of steel I could do
        what my fat owner can't

        Future farmers of America
        future farmers of America
        Future farmers of America

        Always watching the way his wife looks me over
        I have a sex twice as big as her husband's
        If I wasn't so large, so strong, so pale
        I'd disappear under a bush

        Colorless men and ladies of the world unite
        kill your master with one cut of your knife
        Kill them during sex, kill them during talk
        kill them whenever you can

        Future farmers of America
        future farmers of America
        Future farmers of America

        These stupid black owners
        are foreigners to affairs of the heart
        look at me, I'll never own land that I work on
        Every one of us here shares a surname
        this father must die

        I was born on the dark cusp of twilight
        my father was dark, my mother was light
        Look at me, I'm strong
        I could crush him in my fist

        I could crush him in my
        I could crush him in my
        I could crush him in my fist

        I could crush him in my
        I could crush him in my
        I could crush him in my fist

        Future farmers of America
        I could crush him in my fist
        Future farmers of America
        I could crush him in my fist
        Future farmers of America
        I could crush him in my fist

They are the exact words he sings,
not just lyrics I copied from the booklet.



Future farmers of America
--------------------------

Born on a farm in a transatlantic moonlight
Split like a cord of wood my family broke up
Sold like a piece of steer a piece of meat a cow
A breathing piece of shit

They call for my age for my strength and makeup
Called for: I was tall, I was big, I could hold up
A tree or a piece of steel I could do
What my fat owner can't

Oh future farmers of America
Future farmers of America
Future farmers of America

Aah, I'm always watching the way his wife looks me over
I have a sex twice as big as her husband's
If I wasn't so large, so strong, so pale
I'd disappear under a bush

Colorless men and ladies of the world unite
Kill your master with one cut of your knife
Kill them during sex, kill them during talk
Kill them whenever you can

Future farmers of America
Future farmers of America
Future farmers of America

These stupid black owners are foreigners
to affairs of the heart
Look at me! I'll never own land that I work on!
Every one of us here shares a surname
This father must die

I was born on the dark cusp of twilight
My father was dark my mother was light
Look at me I'm strong
I could crush him in my fist

Aah,I could crush him in my
I could crush him in my
I could crush him in my fist
I could crush him in my
I could crush him in my
I could crush him in my fist
Future farmers of America
I could crush him in my fist
Future farmers of America
I could crush him in my fist
Future farmers of America
I could crush him in my fist

"Gassed And Stoked - Loss"
===============================
album _Magic And Loss_
(Lou Reed, 1992)

written by Lou Reed/Mike Rathke
===============================


        Well you covered your tracks and now I can't see you
        you had your ashes scattered at sea
        There's no grave to visit, no tombstone to look at
        you were in the New York Times obituary
        There's no record, no tape, no book, no movie
        some photographs and memories
        Sometimes I dial your phone number by mistake
        and this is what I hear

        This is no longer a working number, baby
        please redial your call
        This is no longer a working number
        your party doesn't live here anymore
        This is no longer a working number
        if you still require help
        Stay on the line and an operator
        will try to bail you out

        I knew I should have seen you that Thursday
        I knew I shouldn't have left
        But you sounded so good, your spirits so up
        I thought I'd see you next week
        I say over and over if I had half a brain
        if I had half a brain in my head
        I wouldn't sit here dialing a wrong number
        and listening to what some recording said

        This is no longer a working number
        please redial your call
        This is no longer a working number
        your party doesn't live here anymore
        This is no longer a working number
        well, if you still require help
        Stay on the line and an operator
        will try to bail you out

        I knew I should have written, written things down
        I always say I'll never forget
        Who can forget a one-eyed pilot
        who's a concert pianist, ah
        A painter, a poet, songwriter supreme
        my friends are blending in my head
        They're melting into one great spirit
        and that spirit isn't dead

        Now I may not remember everything that you said
        but I remember all the sings you've done
        And not a day goes by not an hour
        when I don't try to be like you
        You were gassed, stoked and rarin' to go
        and you were that way all of the time
        So I guess you know why I'm laughing at myselves
        every time I dial the wrong line

        This is no longer a working number, baby
        This is no longer a working number
        Gassed, stoked and rarin' to go
        gassed, stoked and rarin' to go
        gassed, stoked and rarin' to go
        gassed, stoked and rarin' to go
        Gassed, stoked and rarin' to go
        gassed, stoked and rarin' to go
        gassed, stoked and rarin' to go
        gassed, stoked and rarin' to go

        Gentle breeze
        flying through the sunset
        gentle rain
        carrying you away

        Scoop me up
        and fly me through the city
        hold me tight
        let's fly away

        Gentle rain

        What a time
        high above the city
        whisper through my hair

        Hear the wind
        singing how I love you
        hold me tight
        as we fly away

        Who are you
        who are we
        catch the moon
        and swim the sea
        To above us together will be
        flying flying flying

        Take the stars
        and put them in your pocket
        feel the sun
        shining through your hair

        Gentle breeze
        singing can I love you
        hold me tight
        fly away

        Gentle breeze
        yeah yeah
        fly me away

        Fly me away

i think i can fill the gaps:

Hear the wind
singing how I love you
hold me tight
"as we" fly away

and the final word i think it is...

it must be "love",

i'm not sure.

===============================
album _Le Bataclan '72_
(Lou Reed/John Cale/Nico, 2003)

written by John Cale

John Cale: vocal, guitar
Lou Reed: guitar

* a.k.a. "Tired And Hungry"

Jan 29, 1972
Le Bataclan, Paris, France
===============================


        It was seven o'clock in the morning
        too late to handle the day
        At home it was only two thirty
        the skin on my wrists turning grey

        Looked up, wished us good luck
        he changed his attitudes twice
        Clock in the corner shivered in fear
        he was tired and hungry for days

        Next year she bought a new stomach
        from Liverpool made in Detroit
        Constantly passing old matches
        two sentries and millionaires

        Ah, who did, Gallagher did
        the same old thing every time
        Gave up, more empty cups
        they were tired and hungry for nights

        It made life a little easier
        to have Holland on the run
        It didn't take that long to forget her
        my old man and his gun

        Ah, rushed out, ah, lions about
        wasting away on advice
        A hundred and three, four hundred or more
        it'll haunt you for the rest of your life

Lou Reed/John Cale/
Sterling Morrison/Maureen Tucker
================================


        Waldo Jeffers had reached his limit.
        It was now mid-August,
        which meant that he had been separated from Marsha
        for more than two months.
        Two months,
        and all he had to show were three dog-eared letters
        and two very expensive long distance phone calls.
        True when school had ended
        and she had returned to Wisconsin
        and he to Locust, Pennsylvania
        she had sworn to maintain a certain fidelity.
        She would date occasionally but merely as amusement.
        She would remain faithful.
        But lately, Waldo had begun to worry.
        He had trouble sleeping at night,
        and when he did, he had horrible dreams.
        He lay awake at night,
        tossing and turning underneath his pleated quilted protector,
        tears welling in his eyes
        as he pictured Marsha,
        her sworn vows overcome by liquor
        and the smooth soothing of some Neanderthal,
        finally submitting to the final caresses of sexual oblivion.
        It was more than a human mind could bear.
        Visions of Marsha's faithlessness haunted him.
        Daytime fantasies of sexual abandon permeated his thoughts,
        and the thing was,
        they wouldn't understand how she really was.
        He, Waldo, alone understood this.
        He had intuitively grasped every nook and cranny of her psyche.
        He'd made her smile,
        she needed him,
        and he wasn't there.
        (Ahh)

        The idea came to him on the Thursday
        before the Mummer's parade was scheduled to appear.
        He'd just finished mowing and edging Edison's lawn for a dollar fifty
        and then checked the mailbox
        to see if there was at least a word from Marsha.
        There was nothing but a circular from
        The Amalgamated Aluminum Company of America
        inquiring into his awning needs.
        At least they cared enough to write.
        It was a New York company.
        You can go anywhere in the mails.
        Then it struck him.
        He didn't have enough money to go to Wisconsin
        in the accepted fashion, true, but why not mail himself?
        It was absurdly simple.
        He would ship himself, parcel post special delivery.

        The next day Waldo went to the supermarket
        to purchase the necessary equipment.
        He bought masking tape, a staple gun,
        and a medium sized cardboard box
        just right for a person of his build.
        He judged that with a minimum of jostling,
        he could ride quite comfortably.
        A few airholes, some water, perhaps some midnight snacks,
        and it would probably be as good as going tourist.

        By Friday afternoon, Waldo was set.
        He was thoroughly packed and the post office
        had agreed to pick him up at three o'clock.
        He had marked the package "fragile"
        and as he sat curled up inside,
        resting on the foam rubber cushioning he'd thoughtfully included,
        he tried to picture the look of awe and happiness on Marsha's face
        as she opened her door,
        saw the package,
        tipped the deliverer,
        and then opened it to see her Waldo finally there in person.
        She would kiss him,
        and then maybe they could see a movie.
        If he'd only thought of this before.
        Suddenly rough hands gripped his package
        and he felt himself borne up.
        He landed with a thud in a truck and was off.

        Marsha Bronson had just finished setting her hair.
        It had been a very rough weekend.
        She had to remember not to drink like that.
        Bill had been nice about it, though.
        After it was over, he said he still respected her,
        and after all it was certainly the way of nature,
        and even though, no, he didn't love her,
        he did feel an affection for her.
        And after all they were grown adults.
        Oh, what Bill could teach Waldo.
        But that seemed many years ago.

        Sheila Klein, her very very best friend
        walked in through the porch screen door
        and into the kitchen.
        "Oh God, it's absolutely maudlin outside."
        "Ahh, I know what you mean, I feel all icky."
        Marsha tightened the belt on her cotton robe
        with the silk outer edge.
        Sheila ran her finger over some salt grains on the kitchen table,
        Licked her finger and made a face.
        "I'm supposed to be taking these salt pills, but"
        she wrinkled her nose
        "they make me feel like throwing up."
        Marsha started to pat herself under the chin,
        an exercise she'd seen on television.
        "God, don't even talk about that."
        She got up from the table and went to the sink,
        where she picked up a bottle of pink and blue vitamins.
        "Want one? Supposed to be better than steak,"
        and then attempted to touch her knees.
        "I don't think I'll ever touch a Daiquiri again."
        She gave up and sat down,
        this time nearer the small table that supported the telephone.
        "Maybe Bill will call,"
        she said to Sheila's glance.
        Sheila nibbled on her cuticle.
        "After last night, I thought you'd be through with him."
        "I know what you mean.
        My god, he was like an octopus, hands all over the place!"
        she gestured raising her arms upwards in defense.
        "The thing is,
        after a while you're tired of fighting with him you know,
        and after all I didn't really do anything Friday and Saturday,
        so I kind of owed it to him, you know what I mean."
        She started to scratch.
        Sheila was giggling with her hand over her mouth.
        "I tell you, I felt the same way and even, after a while,"
        here she bent forward in a whisper,
        "I wanted to."
        Now she was laughing very loudly.

        It was at this point that Mr. Jameson,
        of the Clarence Darrow Post Office,
        rang the doorbell of the large stucco-covered frame house.
        When Marsha Bronson opened the door,
        he helped her carry the package in.
        He had his yellow and his green slips of paper signed,
        and left with a fifteen cent tip that Marsha had gotten out
        of her mother's small beige pocketbook in the den.
        "What do you think it is?"
        Sheila asked.
        Marsha stood with her arms folded behind her back.
        She stared at the brown cardboard carton
        that sat in the middle of the living-room.
        "I don't know."

        Inside the package, Waldo quivered with excitement
        as he listened to the muffled voices.
        Sheila ran her nail over the masking tape
        that ran down the center of the carton.
        "Why don't you look at the return address and see who it's from."
        Waldo felt his heart beating.
        He could feel the vibrating footsteps.
        It would be soon.
        Marsha walked around the carton and read the ink-scratched label.
        "Ahh, God, It's from Waldo!"
        "That schmuck," said Sheila.
        Waldo trembled with expectation.
        "Well, you might as well open it," said Sheila,
        and both of them tried to lift the stapled flap.
        "Oaah", said Marsha groaning,
        "he must have nailed it shut."
        They tugged on the flap again.
        "My god you need a power drill to get this thing open."
        They pulled again.
        "You can't get a grip."
        They both stood still breathing heavily.
        "Why don't you get a scissor," said Sheila.
        Marsha ran into the kitchen,
        but all she could find was a little sewing scissor.
        Then she remembered that
        her father kept a collection of tools in the basement.
        She ran downstairs,
        and when she came back up,
        she had a large sheet-metal cutter in her hand.
        "This is the best I could find."
        She was very out of breath.
        "Here, you do it, I think I'm gonna die."
        She sank into her large fluffy couch and exhaled noisily.
        Sheila tried to make a slit between the masking tape
        and the end of the cardboard flap,
        But the blade was too big and there wasn't enough room.
        "Goddamn this thing,"
        she said feeling very exasperated.
        Then, smiling,
        "I got an idea."
        "What?" said Marsha.
        "Just watch," said Sheila, touching her finger to her head.

        Inside the package,
        Waldo was so transfixed with excitement
        that he could barely breathe.
        His skin felt prickly from the heat
        and he could feel his heart beating in his throat.
        It would be soon.

        Sheila stood quite upright
        and walked around to the other side of the package.
        Then she sank down to her knees,
        grasped the cutter by both handles,
        took a deep breath,
        and plunged the long blade
        through the middle of the package,
        through the masking tape,
        through the cardboard,
        through the cushioning,
        and right through the center of Waldo Jeffers' head
        which split slightly
        and caused little rhythmic arcs of red
        to pulsate gently in the morning sun.

==============================

L'Olympia, Paris, France
==============================


        Waldo Jeffers had reached his limit.
        It was now mid-August,
        which meant that he'd been separated from Marsha
        for more than two months.
        Two months,
        and all he had to show were three dog-eared letters
        and two very expensive long distance phone calls.
        True when school had ended
        and she had returned to Wisconsin
        and he to Locust, Pennsylvania
        she had sworn to maintain a certain fidelity.
        She would date occasionally but merely as amusement.
        She would remain faithful.
        But lately, Waldo had begun to worry.
        He had trouble sleeping at night,
        and when he did, he had horrible dreams.
        He lay awake at night,
        tossing and turning underneath his pleated quilted protector,
        tears welling in his eyes
        as he pictured Marsha,
        her sworn vows overcome by liquor
        and the smooth soothing of some Neanderthal,
        finally submitting to the final caresses of sexual oblivion.
        It was more than a human mind could bear.
        Visions of Marsha's faithlessness haunted him.
        Daytime fantasies of sexual abandon permeated his thoughts,
        and the thing was,
        they wouldn't understand how she really was.
        He, Waldo, alone understood this.
        He had intuitively grasped every nook and cranny of her psyche.
        He'd made her smile,
        she needed him,
        and he wasn't there.
        Ahh

        The idea came to him on the Thursday before the Mummer's parade
        He'd just finished mowing and edging Edison's lawn for a dollar fifty
        and then checked the mailbox
        to see if there was at least a word from Marsha.
        There was nothing but a circular from
        The Amalgamated Aluminum Company of America
        inquiring into his awning needs.
        At least they cared enough to write.
        It was a New York company.
        You can go anywhere in the mails.
        And then it struck him.
        He didn't have enough money to go to Wisconsin
        in the accepted fashion, true,
        but why not mail himself?
        It was absurdly simple.
        He would ship himself, parcel post special delivery.

        And the next day Waldo went to the supermarket

        and a medium sized cardboard box
        just right for a person of his build.
        He judged that with a minimum of jostling,
        he could ride quite comfortably.
        A few airholes, some water, perhaps some midnight snacks,
        and it would probably be as good as going tourist.

Waldo Jeffers had reached his limit.
It was now Mid-August,
Which meant that he had been separated from Marsha
for more than two months.
Two months, and all he had to show were three dog-eared letters
And two very expensive long distance phone calls.
True when school had ended
And she had returned to Wisconsin
And he to Locust, Pennsylvania
She had sworn to maintain a certain fidelity.
She would date occasionally but merely as amusement.
She would remain faithful.

But lately, Waldo had begun to worry.
He had trouble sleeping at night,
And when he did, he had horrible dreams.
He lay awake at night,
Tossing and turning underneath his pleated quilted protector,
Tears welling in his eyes
As he pictured Marsha, her sworn vows overcome by liquor
and the smooth soothing of some Neanderthal,
Finally submitting to the final caresses of sexual oblivion.
It was more than a human mind could bear.

Visions of Marsha's faithlessness haunted him.
Daytime fantasies of sexual abandon permeated his thoughts,
And the thing was, they wouldn't understand how she really was.
He, Waldo, alone understood this.
He had intuitively grasped every nook and cranny of her psyche.
He'd made her smile--she needed him, and he wasn't there. (Ahh...)

The idea came to him on the Thursday
before the Mummer's parade was scheduled to appear.
He'd just finished mowing and edging Edisons' lawn
for a dollar fifty and then checked the mailbox
to see if there was at least a word from Marsha.
There was nothing but a circular from
The Amalgamated Aluminum Company of America
inquiring into his awning needs.
At least they cared enough to write.
It was a New York company.
You can go anywhere in the mails.

Then it struck him.
He didn't have enough money to go to Wisconsin
in the accepted fashion, true, but why not mail himself?
It was absurdly simple.
He would ship himself, parcel post special delivery.
The next day Waldo went to the supermarket
to purchase the necessary equipment.
He bought masking tape, a staple gun, and a medium sized cardboard box
just right for a person of his build.
He judged that with a minimum of jostling,
He could ride quite comfortably.
A few airholes, some water, perhaps some midnight snacks,
And it would probably be as good as going tourist.

By Friday afternoon, Waldo was set.
He was thoroughly packed and the post office
had agreed to pick him up at three o'clock.
He had marked the package "fragile"
And as he sat curled up inside, resting on the foam-
rubber cushioning he'd thoughtfully included,
He tried to picture the look of awe and happiness on Marsha's face
As she opened her door, saw the package, tipped the deliverer,
And then opened it to see her Waldo finally there in person.
She would kiss him, and then maybe they could see a movie.
If he'd only thought of this before.
Suddenly rough hands gripped his package
And he felt himself borne up.
He landed with a thud in a truck and was off.

Marsha Bronson had just finished setting her hair.
It had been a very rough weekend.
She had to remember not to drink like that.
Bill had been nice about it, though.
After it was over, he said he still respected her,
And after all it was certainly the way of nature,
And even though, no, he didn't love her,
He did feel an affection for her.
And after all they were grown adults.
Oh, what Bill could teach Waldo.
But that seemed many years ago.

Sheila Klein, her very very best friend
Walked in through the porch screen door and into the kitchen.

"Oh God, it's absolutely maudlin outside."

"I know what you mean, I feel all icky."
Marsha tightened the belt on her cotton robe with the silk outer edge.
Sheila ran her finger over some salt grains on the kitchen table,
Licked her finger and made a face.

"I'm supposed to be taking these salt pills, but"-- she wrinkled her
nose--"they make me feel like throwing up."

Marsha started to pat herself under the chin,
an exercise she'd seen on television.
"God, don't even talk about that."
She got up from the table and went to the sink,
Where she picked up a bottle of pink and blue vitamins.
"Want one? Supposed to be better than steak,"
And then attempted to touch her knees.

"I don't think I'll ever touch a Daiquiri again."
She gave up and sat down, this time nearer the small table that
Supported the telephone.
"Maybe Bill will call," she said to Sheila's glance.
Sheila nibbled on her cuticle.

"After last night, I thought you'd be through with him."

"I know what you mean.
My god, he was like an octopus--hands all over the place!"
she gestured raising her arms upwards in defense.
"The thing is, after a while you're tired of fighting with him you
know,
And after all I didn't really do anything Friday and Saturday,
So I kind of owed it to him--you know what I mean."
She started to scratch.

Sheila was giggling with her hand over her mouth.
"I tell you, I felt the same way and even, after a while,"
Here she bent forward in a whisper,
"I wanted to."
Now she was laughing very loudly.

It was at this point that Mr. Jameson,
of the Clarence Darrow Post Office,
rang the doorbell of the large stucco-covered frame house.
When Marsha Bronson opened the door,
He helped her carry the package in.
He had his yellow and his green slips of paper signed,
And left with a fifteen cent tip that Marsha had gotten out
Of her mother's small beige pocketbook in the den.

"What do you think it is?" Sheila asked.

Marsha stood with her arms folded behind her back.
She stared at the brown cardboard carton
That sat in the middle of the living-room.
"I don't know."

Inside the package, Waldo quivered with excitement
As he listened to the muffled voices.
Sheila ran her nail over the masking tape
That ran down the center of the carton.
"Why don't you look at the return address and see who it's from."

Waldo felt his heart beating. He could feel the vibrating footsteps.
It would be soon.

Marsha walked around the carton and read the ink-scratched label.
"God, It's from Waldo!"

"That schmuck," said Sheila.

Waldo trembled with expectation.

"Well, you might as well open it," said Sheila,
and both of them tried to lift the stapled flap.

"Oaah", said Marsha groaning, "he must have nailed it shut."
They tugged on the flap again.
"My god you need a power drill to get this thing open."
They pulled again.
"You can't get a grip."
They both stood still breathing heavily.
"Why don't you get a scissor," said Sheila.
Marsha ran into the kitchen,
but all she could find was a little sewing scissor.
Then she remembered that her father
kept a collection of tools in the basement.
She ran downstairs, and when she came back up,
She had a large sheet-metal cutter in her hand.
"This is the best I could find."
She was very out of breath.
"Here, you do it, I think I'm gonna die."
She sank into her large fluffy couch and exhaled noisily.
Sheila tried to make a slit between
The masking tape and the end of the cardboard flap,
But the blade was too big and there wasn't enough room.
"Goddamn this thing,"
she said feeling very exasperated.
Then, smiling, "I got an idea."
"What?" said Marsha.
"Just watch," said Sheila, touching her finger to her head.

Inside the package, Waldo was so transfixed with excitement
That he could barely breathe. His skin felt prickly from the heat
And he could feel his heart beating in his throat.
It would be soon.

Sheila stood quite upright and walked around to the other side
Of the package. Then she sank down to her knees,
Grasped the cutter by both handles,
Took a deep breath, and plunged the long blade
Through the middle of the package, through the masking tape,
Through the cardboard, through the cushioning,
And right through the center of Waldo Jeffers' head
Which split slightly and caused little
rhythmic arcs of red to pulsate gently in the morning sun.

        it just seems longer, when you're lonely in this world

        Yeah, you're falling all around

"Good Evening Mr. Waldheim"
===========================
album _New York_
(Lou Reed, 1989)

written by Lou Reed
===========================


        Good evening, Mr. Waldheim
        and Pontiff, how are you
        you have so much in common
        in the things you do

        And here comes Jesse Jackson
        he talks of common ground
        does that common ground include me
        or is it just a sound

        A sound that shakes
        oh Jesse, you must watch the sounds you make

        A sound that quakes
        there are fears that still reverberate

        Jesse, you say common ground
        does that include the PLO
        what about people right here right now
        who fought for you not so long ago

        The words that flow so freely
        falling dancing from your lips
        I hope that you don't cheapen them
        with a racist slip

        Oh common ground
        is common ground a word or just a sound
        common ground
        remember those civil rights workers buried in the ground

        If I ran for president
        and once was a member of the Klan
        wouldn't you call me on it
        the way I call you on Farrakhan

        And Pontiff, pretty Pontiff
        can anyone shake your hand
        or is it just that you like uniforms
        and someone kissing your hand

        Or is it true
        the common ground for me includes you, too

        Or is it true
        the common ground for me includes you, too

        Good evening, Mr. Waldheim
        Pontiff, how are you
        as you both stroll through the woods at night
        I'm thinking thoughts of you

        And Jesse, you're inside my thoughts
        as the rhythmic words subside
        my common ground invites you in
        or do you prefer to wait outside

        Or is it true
        the common ground for me is without you

        Or is it true
        the common ground for me is without you

        Or is it true
        there's no ground common enough for me and you

        You're makin' a fool out of yourself
        by followin' me around
        Like a Japanese woman
        who stands ten steps in the shadow of her man

        You're followin' me around

        You're makin' a joke of yourself
        your friends are talkin' behind your back
        You're makin' a joke of yourself
        your friends are talkin' behind your back

        Makin' a fool of yourself over me
        Over me, over me, over me

album _Magic And Loss_
(Lou Reed, 1992)

written by Lou Reed
==============================================


        Sitting on a hard chair
        try to sit straight
        Sitting on a hard chair
        this moment won't wait
        Listening to the speakers
        they're talking about you
        Look at all the people
        all the people you knew

        Sitting with my back straight
        it becomes hard to hear
        Some people are crying
        it becomes hard to hear
        I don't think you'd have liked it
        you would have made a joke
        You would have made it easier
        you'd say, "Tomorrow I'm smoke"

        Sitting on a hard chair
        how far we have come
        Trying hard to listen
        to your friends who have come
        Some of them are famous
        and some are just like me
        Trying hard to listen
        trying hard to see

        Sitting on a hard chair
        it's over time to stand
        Some people are crying
        I turn to grab your hand
        It's your daughter saying thank you
        you, you would have made a joke
        "Isn't this something"
        you'd say, "Tomorrow I'm smoke"

"Goodnight Ladies"
===================
album _Transformer_
(Lou Reed, 1972)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        Goodnight ladies
        ladies goodnight
        It's time to say
        goodbye, let me tell you now

        Goodnight ladies
        ladies goodnight
        It's time to say
        goodbye

        Now all night long
        you've been drinking your tequila
        But now you've sucked
        your lemon peel dry, so why not get high high high
        And goodnight ladies
        ladies goodnight

        Goodnight ladies
        ah, ladies goodnight
        It's time to say
        goodbye

        Goodnight sweet ladies
        ah, ladies goodnight
        It's time to say
        goodbye, bye bye

        Ah, we've been together
        for the longest time
        But now it's time to get high
        come on, let's get high high high
        And goodnight ladies
        ladies goodnight

        Oh, I'm still missing my other half
        oh, it must be something I did in the past
        Don't it just make you wanna laugh
        it's a lonely Saturday night

        Oh, nobody calls me on the telephone
        I put another record on my stereo
        But I'm still singing a song of you
        it's a lonely Saturday night

        Now if I was an actor
        or a dancer who was glamorous
        then you know an amorous life would soon be mine
        But now the tinsel light of starbreak
        is all that's left to applaud my heartbreak
        and at eleven o'clock I watch the network news

        Oh wow wow, something tells me that you're really gone
        you said we could be friends but that's not what I want
        Ah anyway, my TV dinner's almost done
        it's a lonely Saturday night
        I mean to tell you, it's a lonely Saturday night
        One more word, it's a lonely Saturday night

"Gossip Song"
==============================================
from the play _Time Rocker_
(Robert Wilson/Darryl Pinckney/Lou Reed, 1996)

written by Lou Reed

performed by actors, German musicians

Jun 11, 1996
Thalia Theater, Hamburg, Germany
(pre-premiere)
==============================================


        Have you heard that she's pregnant (No)
        yes, she's pregnant again (My God)
        She can't keep her love to herself
        [dialogue in German]

        (Exactly)
        Have you seen the boyfriend (No)
        not only ugly, no future (No)
        Do you think we owe it to her as friends
        [dialogue in German]

        (Exactly)
        To tell her that she really is a slut
        to tell her exactly what is what
        If she's not careful
        she won't have any friends at all
        [dialogue in German]

        (Exactly)
        Did you see who she is dating
        hahaha.., he's hardly a man at all
        He barely smiles
        and when he talks he lisps
        [dialogue in German]

        (Exactly)
        I'd rather go to bed with a broom
        I'd rather tell the truth than lie
        If friends can't tell you the truth
        then really who will
        [dialogue in German]

        I know you'd tell me if I was petty
        I know you'd say if I was small
        If your friends can't tell you
        who bloody hell will
        [dialogue in German]

        She's our best friend but she's ruining her life
        she'll only make it worse if she becomes his wife
        She's not getting any younger
        but can't she do better than this

        Ooohhh-ooohhh, she can do better
        ooohhh-ooohhh-ooohhh, she can do better
        Ooohhh-ooohhh, she can do better than this

        Ooohhh-ooohhh-ooohhh, she can do better
        ooohhh-ooohhh-ooohhh, she can do better
        Ooohhh-ooohhh, she can do better than this

"Gravity"
==========================================================
music inspired by the film _Nanking_ - single (audio file)
(Lou Reed, 2007)

written by Lou Reed
==========================================================


        Gravity is always pull us down
        gravity is always pull us down
        gravity is always pull us down
        pull us down, pull us down

        Gravity makes you lower than this
        what can make you lower than this
        gravity cause you lower than this
        lower than this, lower than this

        What could you do and what could you say
        what could you do and what could you say
        what could you do and why could you say
        it's gravity, gravity

        Beat him in the gut behind the wall
        there's no protection at all
        listening the scream isn't it marvel
        gravity, gravity
        See the low poor squalor

        Gravity, gravity
        a low of nature gravity
        gravity, oh gravity
        there's nothing lower than gravity

        Pull to the left, pull to the right
        gravity all day all night
        some kill this and some rape that
        somehow, somehow worsen that

        Gravity zoom zoom zoom
        gravity keeps us from the moon
        from the stars down to the earth
        gravity what's it worth

        War, war
        we can't get enough from war
        war, war
        we can't get enough from war
        War, war, war, war
        all that lies that's all we saw

        Gravity
        war, war, war, war
        all truth got's they gotten war
        gravity just pull us down
        Gravity just pull us down
        gravity just pull us down
        gravity, gravity
        you can't get away from gravity
        Gravity, gravity
        you can't get away from gravity

"The Great Defender (Down At The Arcade)"
=========================================
album _New Sensations_
(Lou Reed, 1984)

written by Lou Reed
=========================================


        Down at the arcade the defender is there
        down off of Broadway he's there playing his games
        It's very dangerous
        putting money down on Robotron
        Oh, I'm the great defender
        and I really know just how to get along

        Down at the arcade, down at the arcade
        down at the arcade, down at the arcade
        Down at the arcade
        down at the arcade
        Oh, I'm the great defender
        and I really think I've got it made

        A fistful of quarters, a fifty dollar stake
        life is a gamble on video tape
        I called a disc jockey
        to dedicate a song to Blair
        It's the Temps singing, "I'll be there"

        Down at the arcade, down at the arcade
        down at the arcade, down at the arcade
        Down at the arcade
        down at the arcade
        Oh, I'm the great defender
        and I really think I've got it made

        The president called to give me the news
        I've been awarded the Nobel Prize in rhythm and blues
        And Stevie Wonder
        who wants to record one of my songs
        Oh, I'm the great defender
        and I really know just how to get along

        Oh, I'm the great defender, listen to my song
        I really hope you like it, it isn't very long
        It's rooted in the '50s
        but its heart's in 1984
        And if you really like it
        then I sing it for you once more

        Down at the arcade, down at the arcade
        down at the arcade, down at the arcade
        Down at the arcade
        down at the arcade
        Oh, I'm the great defender
        and I really think I've got it made

        Down at the arcade, down at the arcade
        down at the arcade, down at the arcade
        Down at the arcade
        down at the arcade
        ...

"Growing Up In Public"
===================================
album _Growing Up In Public_
(Lou Reed, 1980)

written by Lou Reed/Michael Fonfara
===================================


        Some people are into the power of power
        The absolute corrupting power, that makes great men insane
        While some people find their refreshment in action
        The manipulation, encroachment
        and destruction of their inferiors

        Growing up in public
        growing up in public
        Growing up in public
        growing up in public with your pants down

        Some people are into their sadistic pleasures
        They whet your desires and they drool in your ears
        They're quasi-effeminate characters
        in love with oral gratification
        They edify your integrity, so they can play on your fears

        And they're gonna do it in public
        'cause you're growing up in public
        They're gonna do it to you in public
        'cause you're growing up in public with your pants down

        Some people think being a man is unmanly
        And then some people think that whole concept's a joke
        But some people think being a man is the whole point
        And then some people wish they'd never awoke

        Up from a dream of nightmarish proportions
        Down to a size neither regal nor calm
        A Prince Hamlet caught the middle
        between reason and instinct
        Caught in the middle with your pants down again

        Caught in the middle
        I'm really caught in the middle
        I'm caught in the middle
        caught in the middle, baby, deciding about you

"Guardian Angel"
===================
album _The Raven_
(Lou Reed, 2003)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        I have a guardian angel
        keep him in my head
        When I'm afraid and alone
        I call him to my bed
        I have a guardian angel
        who keeps bad things from me
        The only way to ruin it would be for me
        not to trust me
        The only way to ruin it would be for me
        not to trust me

        I have a guardian angel
        who's often saved my life
        Through malevolent storms and crystal drums
        the angel on my right
        Has lifted me up and set me down
        always showing me what's right
        And if my instinct proved me wrong
        the angel set it right
        And if my instinct proved me wrong
        the angel set it right

        Have a guardian angel
        I keep him in my head
        And when I'm having nightmares
        he shows me dreams instead
        I have a ring, I have a dress
        I have an empty shell
        By the books below tea cups
        I've kept a kind of hell
        By the books below tea cups
        I've kept a kind of hell

        Panic and anxiety
        so often in my head
        But I had a guardian angel
        who took care of me instead
        The champagne cork the nightlight owl
        a raven and a duck
        The seed of pining parents
        and your despairing love
        The seed of pining parents
        and your despairing love

        Love and luck both have charmed lives
        can change all things about
        I had a guardian angel
        that's what this is all about
        I have a guardian angel
        I keep him in my head
        When I'm alone and become afraid
        he saved my life instead
        When I'm alone and become afraid
        he saved my life instead

        Guardian angel
        guardian angel
        Guardian angel
        guardian angel
        Guardian angel

I've tried the best I could to correct the lyrics for
"Guess I'm falling in love"
(the live version from "Peel slowly and see").


Here's what I think he's singing:



I've got fever in my pocket, baby
I've got to groove
Yeah, babe, I guess I'm fallin' in love

I've got fever in my pocket
Down to my shoes
Oh, baby, I guess I'm fallin' in love

I've got it in my pocket, babe
Everything that I can have
I've got things in my love life
That's gonna work out fine
It's gonna be all right

I've got to move
You've got your own love style
Yeah, now, babe, I guess I'm fallin' in love

I've got fever in my pocket
Down to my shoes
Oh, babe, I guess I'm fallin' in love

You better move it on, sweet babe
Hey on down to your shoes
Things they ain't right, mamma
You know it'll work out fine
Hey, you gotta loose

Got a hand in my pocket
You know it's up your street
Oh, babe, I guess I'm fallin' in love

I've got ancles in my bracelets
Spine is hard to move
Oh, baby, I guess I'm fallin' in love
Oh, baby, I guess I'm fallin' in love
Oh, baby, I guess I'm fallin' in love

Shadow 2:

        Guilty



Shadow 1:

        I'm paralyzed with guilt
        It runs through me like rain through silk
        Guilty
        My mind won't leave me alone
        My teeth are rotted
        My lips start to foam
        Cause I'm so guilty



Shadow 2:

        Guilty
        Guilty



Shadow 1:

        Oh guilty
        What did I say
        What did I do
        Did I ever do it to you
        Don't turn your back
        I can't look you in the eye eye eye eye



Shadow 2:

        Eye eye eye



Shadow 1:

        I guess I am guilty as charged



Shadow 2:

        Guilty, guilty, guilty

Shadow 2:

        Don't do what



Shadow 1:

        Don't do that
        Oh you're such a child
        Guilty
        What can I do
        I do it to you
        But I do it to me too
        Cut off my head
        Hang me from the yardarm
        Guilty
        I'm paralyzed with guilt
        I've got bad thoughts
        I've got an evil clit



Shadow 2:

        Guilty



Shadow 1:

        My mind won't leave me alone
        I've got a bad mind
        I've got a bad bone



Shadow 2:

        Guilty
        Guilty as charged
        Guilty



Shadow 1:

        Don't do that



Shadow 2:

        Don't do what



Shadow 1:

        Don't do that
        Oh you're such a reckless child
        Do you remember when you were a baby
        Do you have a jury



Shadow 2:

        Yeah



Shadow 1:

        Do you have a verdict



Shadow 2:

        Guilty as charged
        Guilty
        Guilty
        Guilty as charged



Shadow 1:

        Do you have a verdict
        Do you have a verdict
        I'm guilty



Shadow 2:

        You're guilty



Shadow 1:

        Oh you're such a reckless child
        I should beat you
        I should hit you
        I will put you in therapy



Shadow 2:

        Guilty
        Guilty
        Guilty
        Guilty

        I am paralyzed with guilt
        It runs through me like a rain through silk
        Guilty, my mind won't leave me alone

"The Gun"
=====================
album _The Blue Mask_
(Lou Reed, 1982)

written by Lou Reed
=====================


        The man has a gun
        he knows how to use it
        Nine millimeter Browning
        let's see what he can do
        He'll point it at your mouth
        says that he'll blow your brains out
        Don't you mess with me
        carrying a gun
        Carrying a gun
        carrying a gun
        Don't you mess with me
        carrying a gun
        Carrying a gun
        carrying a gun
        Don't mess with me, mmmm..
        carrying a gun
        Get over there
        move slowly
        I'll put a hole in your face
        if you even breathe a word
        Tell the lady to lie down
        I want, ah, you to be sure to see this
        I wouldn't want you to miss a second
        watch your wife
        Carrying a gun
        shooting with a gun
        Dirty animal

        Carrying a gun
        carrying a gun
        Watch you face
        carrying a gun
        Carrying a gun
        carrying a gun
        The animal dies with fear in his eyes
        with a gun
        Don't touch him, don't touch him
        stay away from him, he's got a gun

"Halloween Parade"
===================
album _New York_
(Lou Reed, 1989)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        There's a downtown fairy singing out "Proud Mary"
        as she cruises Christopher Street
        And some southern queen is acting loud and mean
        where the docks and the badlands meet

        This Halloween
        is something to be sure
        Especially
        to be here without you

        There's a Greta Garbo and an Alfred Hitchcock
        and some black Jamaican stud
        There's five Cinderellas and some leather drags
        I almost fell into my mug

        There's a Crawford, Davis
        and a tacky Cary Grant
        And some homeboys lookin'
        for trouble down here from the Bronx

        But there ain't no Hairy and no Virgin Mary
        you won't hear those voices again
        And Johnny Rio and Rotten Rita
        you'll never see those faces again

        This Halloween
        is something to be sure
        Especially
        to be here without you

        There's the Born Again Losers and the Lavender Boozers
        and some crack team from Washington Heights
        The boys from Avenue B, the girls from Avenue D
        a Tinkerbell in tights

        This celebration
        somehow gets me down
        Especially
        when I see you're not around

        There's no Peter Pedantic saying things romantic
        in Latin, Greek or Spic
        There's no Three Bananas or Brandy Alexander
        dishing all their tricks

        It's a different feeling
        that I have today
        Especially
        when I know you've gone away

        There's a girl from Soho with a T-shirt saying "I Blow"
        she's with the "Jive Five 2 Plus 3"
        And the girls for pay dates are giving cut rates
        or else doing it for free

        The past keeps knock-knock
        knocking on my door
        And I don't want to
        hear it anymore

        No consolations please for feelin' funky
        I got to get my head above my knees
        But it makes me mad and mad, makes me sad
        and then I start to freeze

        In the back of my mind
        I was afraid it might be true
        In the back of my mind
        I was afraid that they meant you

"Hang On To Your Emotions"
================================
album _Set The Twilight Reeling_
(Lou Reed, 1996)

written by Lou Reed
================================


        When your imagination has too much to say
        when the chill of the night meets the sweat of the day
        And you have trouble understanding
        what other people have to say
        you'd better -

        Hang on to your emotions
        hang on to your emotions

        When a demagogue inside your head has taken charge
        and by default what you say or do is criticized
        And this litany of failures
        is recited a thousand times
        you'd better -

        Hang on to your emotions
        hang on to your emotions

        Could it be you've never felt like that
        that your mind's a cage inside the cage a cat
        that spits and scratches all it can get at

        And that's you and your emotions

        Could it be you've never felt like that
        your mind's a cage inside the cage a rat
        rabidly trying to get at

        You and your emotions
        you and your emotions

        When your imagination has too much to say
        when that facile voice inside your head
        says give your life away
        You might think to ask how it got that way
        what books it has read that make it that way
        And where it got the right to speak to anyone that way
        you'd better -

        Hold on to your emotions
        hold on to your emotions

        When a night city's breeze blows across the room
        and a 5 a.m. moon and sun start their swoon
        You hear your lover's breath
        and not a moment too soon
        you get to -

        Release all your emotions, you get to -
        let go of your emotions, and now -
        Release all your emotions, you'd better -
        let go of your emotions

        Release, I wanna let go
        I wanna release now

"Hangin' 'Round"
===================
album _Transformer_
(Lou Reed, 1972)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        Harry was a rich young man
        who would become a priest
        He dug up his dear father
        who was recently deceased

        He did it with tarot cards
        and a mystically attuned mind
        And shortly there
        and after he did find

        Jeanie was a spoiled young brat
        she thought she knew it all
        She smoked mentholated cigarettes
        and she had sex in the hall

        But she was not my kind
        or even of my sign
        The kind of animal
        that I would be about

        Wow-wow-wow, you keep hangin' round me
        and I'm not so glad you found me
        You're still doing things that I gave up years ago
        Oh-wow-wow-wow, you keep hangin' round me
        and I'm not so glad you found me
        You're still doing things that I gave up years ago
        alright now
        ah-huh-huh

        Kathy was a bit surreal
        she painted all her toes
        And on her face she wore dentures
        clamped tightly to her nose

        And when she finally spoke
        her twang her glasses broke
        And no one else could smoke
        while she was in the room

        Hark, the herald angels sang
        and reached out for a phone
        And plucking it with a knife in hand
        dialed long distance home

        But it was all too much
        sprinkling angel dust
        To AT and T
        who didn't wish you well

        Oh, but you keep hangin' round me
        and I'm not so glad you found me
        You're still doing things that I gave up years ago
        Ho-ho-ho-ho, you keep hangin' round me
        and I'm not so glad you found me
        You're still doing things that I gave up years ago

        Hangin' round
        hangin' round, that's all you're doing baby
        Hangin' round
        hangin' round, ooohhh
        Hangin' round
        hangin' round
        Hangin' round
        hangin' round
        ...

"Hangin' 'Round"
(acoustic demo)
======================
album _Transformer_
reissue CD bonus track
(Lou Reed, 2002)
======================


        Harry was a rich young man
        who would become a priest
        He studied with his father
        who was recently deceased

        He did it with tarot cards
        and a mystically attuned mind
        And shortly there
        and after he did find

        Jeanie was a spoiled young brat
        she thought she knew it all
        She smoked mentholated cigarettes
        and had sex in the hall

        But she was not my sign
        or any of the kind
        The ............
        that I would be about

        But you keep hangin' round me
        and I'm not so glad you found me
        You're still doing things that I gave up years ago
        Oh, you're still hangin' round me
        and I'm not so glad you found me
        You're still ....... things that I gave up years ago

        Raymond was a stranger
        who had come from parts unknown
        He had no hair upon his head
        so he did not use a comb

        But ............
        and everyday did, babe
        And when at last he found himself
        ........... clean the ......

        Kathy was a bit surreal
        she painted all her toes
        On her face she wore dentures
        clamped tightly to her nose

        And when she finally spoke
        her twang her glasses broke
        And no one else could smoke
        while she was in the room

        But you keep hangin' round me
        and I'm not very glad you found me
        You're still doing things that I gave up years ago
        Oh-wow-wow-wow, you're still hangin' round me
        and I'm not so glad you found me
        You're still doing things that I gave up years ago

        Hark, the herald angels sang
        and reached out for a phone
        And plucking it with ivory in hand
        dialed long distance home

        But it was all too much
        sprinkling angel dust
        To A and T
        who didn't wish you well not at all

        But-but-but you keep hangin' round me
        and I'm not so glad you found me
        You're still doing things that I gave up years ago
        Ho-wow-wow-wow-wow, you're still hangin' round me
        and I'm not so glad you found me
        You're still doing things that I gave up years ago
        You're still hangin' round me
        and I'm not, no-no, glad you found me
        You're still doing things that I gave up years ago
        no-no-no-no

        Looking in the mirror
        Harry didn't like what he saw
        The cheeks of his mother
        The eyes of his father
        As each day crashed around him the future stood revealed
        He was turning into his parents

        The final disappointment

        Stepping out of the shower
        Harry stared at himself
        His hairline receding, the slight overbite

        He picked up the razor to begin his shaving and thought

        Oh
        I wish I was different

        I wish I was stronger
        I wish I was thinner
        I wish I didn't have this nose
        these ears that stick out remind me of my father

        And I don't want to be reminded at all

        The final disappointment

        Harry looked in the mirror thinking of Vincent van Gogh

        And with a quick swipe
        Lopped off his nose

        And happy with that
        He made a slice where his chin was
        He'd always wanted a dimple

        The end of all illusion

        Then peering down straight between his legs
        Harry thought of the range of possibilities

        A new face, a new life, no memories of the past
        and slit his throat from ear to ear

        Harry woke up with a cough, the stitches made him wince
        A doctor smiled at him from somewhere across the room

        Son
        We saved your life, but you'll never look the same

        And when he heard that
        Harry had to laugh

        And when he heard that
        Harry had to laugh

        Although it hurt
        Harry had to laugh

        The final disappointment

==============================


        Mama told me ever since I was seven
        hold your head up high
        My parents told me ever since I was eleven
        hold your head up high

        They said the answer was to become a dancer
        hold your head up high
        Oh, just like I figured, they all was disfigured
        with their head up high

        Now I am older, I'm getting so much bolder
        with my head up high
        Oh, as I figured, just like I figured
        set your heads up high, baby

        Oh, now just like I figured, you know they was disfigured
        hold your head up high
        You know they says the answer was to become a dancer
        hold your head up high, boy

        Ever since I was a baby on my mama's knee
        Oh, just listenin' to what everybody told me
        yeah yes, they did

        But still the answer was to become a dancer
        hey, hold your head up high
        But just like I figured, they all was disfigured
        they hold their heads up high, watch out

        Yeah, do the dog
        Oh, watch out

        And now I'm older, they say I'm so much bolder
        got your head up high, oh-oh-oh
        Oh, the answer was, hey, become a dancer
        head up high

        Well, but just like I figured, they're always disfigured
        they got their heads up high, oh-wow
        But the answer was, now boy, become a dancer
        with your head up high, oh

        Head held high, yeah-yeah-yeah
        head held high, oh baby
        Head held high, oh-wow now
        head held high, hey-yeah-yeah-yeah

        Mama told me ever since I was seven
        hold your head up high
        My parents told me ever since I was eleven
        hold your head up high

        Just like I figured, you know they was disfigured
        hold your head up high
        You know they says the answer was to become a dancer
        hold your head up high, boy

        Ever since I was a baby on my mama's knee
        Oh, just listenin' to what everybody told me
        yeah yes, they did

        But still the answer was to become a dancer
        hey, hold your head up high
        But just like I figured, they all was disfigured

        Well, but just like I figured, they're always disfigured
        they got their heads up high, oh-wow
        But the answer was, now boy, become a dancer
        with your head up high, oh

"Heavenly Arms"
=====================
album _The Blue Mask_
(Lou Reed, 1982)

written by Lou Reed
=====================


        Heavenly arms reach out to hold me
        Heavenly arms entice you to dance
        In a world of ill will, the dancers are still
        Heavenly arms reach out to me

        Heavenly arms soft as a love song
        Heavenly arms bring a kiss to your ear
        In a world that seems mad, all the dancers seem sad
        Heavenly arms reach out to me

        Sylvia
        Sylvia
        Sylvia
        Sylvia

        Heavenly arms come to my rescue
        Only a woman can love a man
        In a world full of hate, love should never wait
        Heavenly arms reach out to me

        Heavenly arms strong as a sunset
        Heavenly arms pure as the rain
        Lovers stand warned of the world's impending storm
        Heavenly arms reach out to me

        Sylvia
        Sylvia
        Sylvia
        Sylvia

        Oh-oh-woh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
        Ooohhh-ooohhh-ooohhh-ooohhh-ooohhh, oh-wow-woh
        Mmmm.., oh-woh-woh

"Hello It's Me"
=============================
album _Songs For Drella_
(Lou Reed/John Cale, 1990)

written by Lou Reed/John Cale
=============================


        Andy it's me, haven't seen you in a while
        I wish I'd talked to you more when you were alive
        I thought you were self-assured when you acted shy
        hello it's me

        I really miss you, I really miss your mind
        I haven't heard ideas like that for such a long long time
        I loved to watch you draw and watch you paint
        but when I saw you last, I turned away

        When Billy Name was sick and locked up in his room
        you asked me for some speed, I thought it was for you
        I'm sorry if I doubted your good heart
        things always seem to end before they start

        Hello it's me, that was a great gallery show
        your cow wallpaper and your floating silver pillows
        I wish I paid more attention when they laughed at you
        hello it's me

        "Pop goes pop artist," the headline said
        "is shooting a put on, is Warhol really dead?"
        You get less time for stealing a car
        I remember thinking as I heard my own record in a bar

        They really hated you, now all that's changed
        but I have some resentments that can never be unmade
        You hit me where it hurt I didn't laugh
        your Diaries are not a worthy epitaph

        Oh well now Andy, I guess we've got to go
        I wish someway somehow you like this little show
        I know this is late in coming but it's the only way I know
        hello it's me

        Goodnight, Andy

        Goodbye, Andy

        I just wanna tell you a story
        it happened to a friend of mine
        Didn't have no power and no glory
        said he didn't have the time
        He said he was a happy kind of person
        do anything to find out 'bout this girl
        She went and then she married another fellow
        knocked my friend right out of this world
        he heard the preacher say
        Here comes the bride

        (Here comes the bride)
        It haunts him every night, he is in hell
        here comes the bride, baby

        Somebody call his Aunt Carrie
        and tell her that nephew Jimmy is comin' in from Vermont
        via the coast
        And somebody call up his old man
        hey you, tell him that his son's arriving
        and he's looking like a ghost
        And somebody find that Virgin Mary
        oh, won't you tell that bitch
        hey, your Jimmy's a comin' back home
        And somebody tell those ladies in waiting, "Hold it now"
        and don't tell the preacher go on with it
        we don't want to hear those words
        Oh, here comes the bride

        (Here comes the bride)
        I don't want to hear it now
        yeah-yeah-yeah, here comes the bride
        (here comes the bride)
        here comes the bride

Here is the first attempt at Here comes the Bride.
I will post it on my list and see if anyone can work out the gaps



"Here Comes The Bride"


Listen, I wanna tell you a story
It Happened to a True friend of mine
He didn't have no power and the glory
They said he didn't know how to have a good time???
They said he was a hard(?) kind of person
The only thing that ?he had was? his girl
She went and married another fellow
It knocked my friend right out of this world
He heard the preacher say "Here comes the Bride"
(Here comes the Bride)
It haunts him every night. He is in Hell
Here comes the Bride baby (Here comes the Bride)
???
Here comes the Bride (Here comes the Bride)
Hey doesn't she look lovely (Lovely)
Here comes the Bride

Somebody ???
Tell her that ya ??? near the coast
And somebody call up his old man
Yeah you tell him that your son's arriving
??? is looking like a ghost
And somebody find that Virgin Mary
Oh Won't you tell that Bitch "Hey your Jimmy Is Coming back home"
And somebody tell those ladies in waiting "Hold it now"
Don't tell the preacher "Go on with it"
We don't want to hear words.
Oh Here comes the Bride (Here comes the Bride)
I don't want to hear it now 
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Here comes the Bride (Here comes the Bride)
Here comes the Bride (Here comes the Bride)
Yeah and Jimmy looks for love? like lovely?
And don't you know the Preacher looks ugly?
Yeah (Here comes the Bride)
Yeah Yeah Here comes the Bride
(Here comes the Bride, Here comes the Bride ...)

@SONG:  Here Comes the Bride

Listen, I just wanna tell you a story
It happened to a friend of mine
Didn't have no power in the glory
City took a hell of a time??
The city was ahead kind of pushing
The only thing this about this girl
She went and she married another fellow
Knocked my friend right out of this world

He heard the preacher say here comes the bride 
(here comes the bride)
Here comes the bride, baby      (here comes the bride)
?       (here comes the bride)
She looked lovely, here comes the bride

Somebody called to say they caring
Tell her that a refugee is coming in Philmont via the coast
Somebody call up his old man
Hey, tell him his son is a writer and ?? looking like a ghost
And somebody find that Virgin Mary
Oh, won't you tell that bitch,
hey your two bees are coming back home
Somebody tell those ladies in waiting, hold it now
Don't tell the preacher, go on with it 
We don't want to hear the words

Here comes the bride (here comes the bride)
I don't want to hear it, here comes the bride (here comes the bride)
Here comes the bride  (here comes the bride)
Looks so lovely, so lovely, so lovely,
Don't you know the preacher looks so lovely, yeah yeah
Here comes the bride (here comes the bride)
(here comes the bride)

"Heroin"
=======================================
album _The Velvet Underground and Nico_
(The Velvet Underground, 1967)

written by Lou Reed
=======================================


        I don't know just where I'm going
        But I'm gonna try for the kingdom if I can
        'Cause it makes me feel like I'm a man
        When I put a spike into my vein
        Then I tell you things aren't quite the same
        When I'm rushing on my run
        And I feel just like Jesus' son
        And I guess that I just don't know
        And I guess that I just don't know

        I have made big decision
        I'm gonna try to nullify my life
        'Cause when the blood begins to flow
        When it shoots up the dropper's neck
        When I'm closing in on death

        And you can't help me, not you guys
        Or all you sweet girls with all your sweet talk
        You can all go take a walk
        And I guess I just don't know
        And I guess that I just don't know

        I wish that I was born a thousand years ago
        I wish that I'd sailed the darkened seas
        On a great big clipper ship
        Going from this land here to that
        Ah, in a sailor's suit and cap

        Away from the big city
        Where a man cannot be free
        Of all the evils of this town
        And of himself and those around
        Oh, and I guess that I just don't know
        Oh, and I guess that I just don't know

        Heroin, be the death of me
        Heroin, it's my wife and it's my life, haha
        Because a mainer to my vein
        Leads to a center in my head
        And then I'm better off than dead

        Because when the smack begins to flow
        I really don't care anymore
        About all the Jim-Jims in this town
        And all the politicians making crazy sounds
        And everybody putting everybody else down
        And all the dead bodies piled up in mounds

        'Cause when the smack begins to flow

San Francisco, California
==================================================


        I don't know just where I'm going
        And I'm going to try for the kingdom if I can
        'Cause it makes my feel like I'm a man
        When I put a spike into my vein
        Then I tell ya things aren't quite the same
        When I'm rushing on my run
        And I feel just like Jesus' son
        And I guess I just don't know
        And I guess that I just don't know

        I have made very big decision
        I'm going to try to nullify my life
        'Cause when the blood begins to flow
        When it shoots up the dropper's neck
        When I'm closing in on death

        You can't help me, not you guys
        Or all you girls with all your sweet pretty talk

        Oh, you can all go take a walk

        And I guess I just don't know
        And I guess that I just don't know

        I wish that I was born a thousand years ago
        I wish that I'd sailed the darkened seas
        On a great big clipper ship
        Going from -

        - this land here and that

        Away from big city
        Where a man cannot be free
        Of all the evils of this town
        And of himself and those around

        And I guess I just don't know
        And I guess that I just don't know

        Heroin, pretty babe, be the death of me
        Heroin, you know it's my wife and it's my life
        Because a mainer to my vein
        Leads to a center in my head, ah

        And then I'm better off than dead

        When the smack begins to flow
        Then I really don't care anymore
        'Bout all your Jim-Jims in this town
        And everybody puttin' everybody else down
        All the politicians making crazy sounds
        And all the dead bodies piled up in mounds

        'Cause while that heroin is in my blood
        Then the blood is in my head, oh
        Thank God that I'm good as dead
        Thank God that I'm not aware
        And I guess I just don't know

        And I, I wish that I'd sailed the darkened seas
        On a great big clipper ship
        Going from this land here to that
        I put on a, a sailor's suit and cap

        Away from the big city
        Where a man cannot be free
        Of all the evils in this town
        Ooohhh baby, himself and those around

        Because a mainer to my brain
        Leads to a center in my head
        And then I'm better off than dead

        When the smack begins to flow
        I really don't care anymore
        About all the Jim-Jims in this
        Everybody puttin' everybody else down
        And all the politicians makin' crazy sounds
        And all the dead bodies piled up in mounds
        Oh yeah

        Ah, while that heroin is in my blood
        And the blood is in my head
        Thank God that I'm good as dead
        Thank God that I'm not aware
        Thank God that I just don't care
        And I guess I just don't know
        And I guess that I just don't

=============================================


        I don't know just where I'm going
        And I'm going to try for the kingdom when I can
        'Cause it makes my feel like I'm a man
        When I put a spike into my vein
        Then I tell you things aren't quite the same
        When I'm rushing on my run
        And I feel just like Jesus' son
        And I guess I just don't know
        And I guess that I just don't know

        Now I have made very big decision
        And I'm going to try to nullify my life
        'Cause when the blood begins to flow
        When it shoots up the dropper's neck
        When I'm closing in on death

        You can't help me, not you guys
        Or all you sweet pretty girls
        with all your sweet pretty talk
        You can all go take a walk
        And I guess I just don't know
        And I guess that I just don't know

        Now I wish that I was born a thousand years ago
        And I wish that I'd sailed the darkened seas
        On a great big clipper ship
        Going from this land here to that

        Away from the big city
        Where a man cannot be free
        Of all the evils of this town
        And I guess I just don't know
        And I guess that I just don't know

        Heroin, be the death of me
        Heroin, you know that it's my wife, it's my life
        Because a mainer to my vein
        Leads to a center in my head

        And then I'm better off than dead

        Because when the smack begins to flow
        Oh, I really don't care anymore
        'Bout all your Jim-Jims in this town
        And everybody putting everybody else down
        And all the politicians making crazy sounds
        And all the dead bodies piled up in mounds

        And I guess that I just don't know
        And I guess that I just don't know

        I have made a big decision
        I'm gonna nullify my life
        When the blood begins to flow
        When it squirts as the dropper's neck
        When the smack goes and hits my blood
        When I'm closing in on death
        And my head begins to brow
        You can't hit me, not you girl
        All you guys sweet all your talk
        You can all go take a walk
        Down the sheets and off the floors
        Through the windows with the people's halls
        And the cars with the people round
        And I love the people of my town
        And I guess that I just don't know
        Oh, I guess that I just don't know

        I wish that I lived a hundred years ago
        I wish that I'd sailed the darkened seas
        On a great big clipper ship
        Going from this land here to that
        In a sailor's suit and cap
        Go away from that big city
        Where a man cannot be free
        From the evils of this town
        Of himself and those around
        Wish I travelled all around
        But I guess that I just don't know
        And I guess that I just don't know

        Heroin is gonna be the death of me
        Heroin, it's my life and it's my wife
        'Cause the mainer to my vein
        Leads to a center in my head
        And then I'm better off than dead
        With that smack blood starting to flow
        When I really don't care no more
        About all the Jim-Jims in this town
        All the animals making sounds
        People selling people a poun-poun-pound
        And the politicians and the clowns
        And all the too-gooders with their frowns
        And the dead bodies all piled in mounds
        But while the heroin is in my blood
        And the blood is in my head
        I thank god that I'm good as dead
        And thank god that I'm not aware
        And thank god that I just don't care
        I guess that I just don't know
        And I guess that I just don't know

==========================================


        I don't know just where I'm going
        But I'm goin' to try for the kingdom if I can
        'Cause it makes me feel like I'm a man
        When I put a spike into my vein
        Then I tell you things aren't quite the same
        ah-huh

        When I'm rushing on my run
        And I feel just like Jesus' son
        And I guess I just don't know
        And I guess that I just don't know

        I have made a very big decision
        I'm goin' to try to nullify my life
        'Cause when the blood begins to flow
        When it shoots up the dropper's neck
        When I'm closing in on death

        You can't help me, not you guys
        Or all you sweet pretty girls
        with all your sweet pretty talk
        You can all go take a walk
        And I guess I just don't know
        And I guess that I just don't know

        Tell you a diary, junkie's dream, hahaha.. hahaha..

        I wish that I was born a thousand years ago
        I wish that I'd sailed the darkened seas
        On a great big clipper ship
        Going from this land here to that
        I put on a sailor's suit and a cap

        Away from the big city
        Where a man cannot be free
        Of all the evils in this town
        And of himself and those around
        Oh, and I guess I just don't know
        Oh, and I guess that I just don't know

        Heroin, be the death of me
        Heroin, it's my wife and it's my life
        Because a mainer to my vein
        Leads to a center in my head
        And then I'm better off than dead

        Because when the smack begins to flow
        Oh, I really don't care anymore
        About all your Jim-Jims in this town
        And everybody putting everybody else down

        And all the dead bodies piled up in mounds
        oh

        Ah, while that heroin is in my blood
        And that blood is in my head
        Yeah, thank God that I'm good as dead
        And thank God that I'm not aware
        And thank God that I just don't care
        And I guess I just don't know

        And I guess I just don't know
        And I guess that I just don't know

        Heroin, be the death of me
        Heroin, it's my wife and it's my life
        Because a mainer to my vein
        Leads to a center in my head
        And then I'm better off than dead

        Because when the smack begins to flow
        Then I really don't care anymore
        About all your Jim-Jims in this town
        And everybody putting everybody else down
        And all the politicians making crazy sounds
        And all the dead bodies piled up in mounds

        While that heroin is in my blood
        And that blood is in my head
        Man thank God that I'm good as dead
        Thank God that I'm not aware
        And thank God that I just don't care
        And I guess I just don't know

The Wiltern, Los Angeles
========================


        I don't know just where I'm going
        But I'm going to try for the kingdom if I can
        'Cause it makes me feel like I'm a man
        When I put a spike into my vein
        Then I tell you things aren't quite the same
        When I'm rushing on my run
        And I feel just like Jesus' son
        And I guess that I just don't know
        And I guess that I just don't know

        I have made a very big decision
        I'm going to try to nullify my life
        'Cause when the blood begins to flow
        When it shoots up the dropper's neck
        When I'm closing in on death

        You can't help me, not you guys
        Or all you pretty girls with all your sweet pretty talk
        You could all go take a walk
        And I guess that I just don't know
        And I guess that I just don't know

        I'll be your mirror
        I'll be your mirror

        I, I wish that I was born a thousand years ago
        I, I wish that I'd sailed the darkened seas
        On a great big clipper ship
        Going from this land here to that
        Put on a sailor's suit and cap

        Away from the big city
        Where a man cannot be free
        Of all of the evils in this town
        And of himself and those around
        And I guess that I just don't know
        And I guess that I just don't know

        Heroin, be the death of me
        Heroin, it's my wife and it's my life
        Because a mainer to my vein
        Leads to a center in my head
        And then I'm better off than dead

Here's my interpretation of what Lou's singing on the last take
of Heroin on "Peel slowly and see":



I know just where I'm going
I'm gonna try for the kingdom, if I can
'Cause it makes me feel that I'm a man
When I put the spike into my vein
Then things aren't quite the same
When I'm rushing from my run
And I feel like Jesus' son
And I guess that I just don't know
And I guess that I just don't know

I have made a big decision
I'm gonna nullify my life
When the blood begins to flow
When it squirts up the dropper's neck
When the smack goes and hits my blood
When I'm closing in on death
And my head begins to well
And you can't help me, not you girls
All you guys with all your talk
You can all go take a walk
Down the sheets and off the floors
Through the windows with the people's halls
And the cars with the people round
And I love the people of my town
And I guess that I just don't know
Oh, I guess that I just don't know

I wish that I lived a 100 years ago
I wish that I'd sailed the darkened seas
On a great big clipper ship
Going from this land here to that
In a sailor's suit and cap
Go away from the big city
Where a man cannot be free
From the evils of this town
Of himself and those around
I wish I traveled all around
But I guess that I just don't know
And I guess that I just don't know

Heroin is gonna be the death of me
Heroin, it's my life and it's my wife
'Cause the mainer to my vein
Leads to a center in my head
And then I'm better off than dead
With that smack blood starting to flow
When I really don't care no more
About all the Jim-Jims in this town
All the animals making sounds
People selling people a p-p-p-pound
And the politicians and the clowns
And the too-gooders with their frowns
And the dead bodies all piled in mounds
But while the heroin is in my blood
And the blood is in my head
I thank God that I'm good as dead
And thank God that I'm not aware
And thank God that I don't care
I guess that I just don't know
And I guess that I just don't know

I bought the French translation of "Between thought and expression"
and in the lyrics of Heroin,
there's a difference between your version and the one in the book:


Heroin be the death of me
... Because a mainer to my vein
Leads to a center in my head...

I thought the following slang terms are more likely
what Lou is singing in Heroin (all versions):

mainers = main line

(from Webster's Collegiate Dictionary,
1995, Random House pub., New York)
"main' line' n. 2. Slang. a readily accessible vein
that can be used for the injection of a narcotic"

Jim-Jims= jim-jams
(also from Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 1995)
"jim-jams n. Slang.
1. extreme nervousness, jitters 2. delirium tremens"

Just ideas, I don't know if your lyrics are confirmed
by some published source or not,
but I have just always thought these to be right.

One thing though, I was reading the lyrics to Heroin,
and some guy is saying that Lou Reed is singing
"jim-jams" instead of "jim-jims" which is not true.
Lou is not using common slang, but making up his own words.
I read in the liner notes some vinyl reissues
and in a book that Lou was creating his own language,
which elevated his work to that of a poet's.
So, jim-jams is not correct at all.

"The Heroine"
=====================
album _The Blue Mask_
(Lou Reed, 1982)

written by Lou Reed
=====================


        The heroine stood up on the deck
        the ship was out of control
        the bow was being ripped to shreds
        men were fighting down below
        The sea had pummeled them for so long
        that they knew nothing but fear

        And the baby's in the box
        he thinks the door is locked
        the sea is in a state
        the baby learns to wait for the heroine
        Ooohhh-ooohhh, for the heroine
        locked in his defense, he waits for the heroine

        The mast is cracking as the waves are slapping
        sailors rolled across the deck
        and when they thought no one was looking
        they would cut a weaker man's neck
        While the heroine dressed in a virgin white dress
        tried to steer the mighty ship
        But the raging storm wouldn't hear of it
        they were in for a long trip

        Baby's in the box
        thinks the door is locked
        he finds it hard to breathe
        drawing in the sea
        And where's the heroine to fire off the gun
        to calm the raging seas
        and let herself be seized by the -

        - Baby in the box
        he thinks the door is locked
        the woman has the keys
        but there's no moment she can seize
        Here's to the heroine
        who transcends all the men
        Who are locked inside the box
        will the lady let him out
        Ooohhh, the heroine, ooohhh-ooohhh, the heroine
        Strapped to the mast, the pale ascendant heroine
        strapped to the mast, the pale ascendant heroine

On Hey Mr Rain, during the verse,
the chord change goes from E to F, not E to A.

You can see this clearly on the Velvet Redux 1993 DVD
where Lou is playing an E barre chord at the 7th fret
and then just moves the chord up one fret to play an F
at the 8th fret.

"High In The City"
======================
album _New Sensations_
(Lou Reed, 1984)

written by Lou Reed
======================


        I got the time, I got my feet
        let's go hit the street
        High in the city
        high in the city

        I got my mace and you got your knife
        you gotta protect your own life
        High in the city
        high in the city

        I wanna get high in the city
        I wanna stay alive here in the city
        I wanna stay high in the city
        High in the city
        high in the city

        Let's not walk down Sutton Place
        you know everybody there's gotten Akitas
        High in the city
        high in the city

        Don't want to talk politics today
        I feel too good, let me have my way
        High in the city
        high in the city

        Watch out for that guy on your right
        seen him on the news last Saturday night
        He was high in the city
        high in the city

        Hey, look they're setting fire to that jeep
        there's not much you can keep
        High in the city
        here in the city

        I wanna get high in the city
        I wanna stay alive in the city
        I wanna stay high in the city
        High in the city
        high in the city

        So many people feeling low
        and there's only one way to go -
        - To get high in the city
        high in the city

        Let's grab a pie, let's hit the park
        I'll kiss and hug you till it gets dark
        Here in the city
        getting high in the city

        (High in the city)

        (High in the city and you're looking so pretty)

"Hold On"
===================
album _New York_
(Lou Reed, 1989)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        There's blacks with knives and whites with clubs
        fighting in Howard Beach
        There's no such thing as human rights
        when you walk the New York streets
        A cop was shot in the head by a 10 years old kid
        named Buddah in Central Park last week
        The fathers and daughters are lined up by the coffins
        by the Statue of Bigotry, hey

        You better hold on
        something's happening here
        You better hold on
        well I'll meet you in Tompkins Square

        The dopers sent a message to the cops last weekend
        they shot him in the car where he sat
        And Eleanor Bumpers and Michael Stewart
        must have appreciated that
        There's a rampaging rage rising up like a plague
        of bloody vials washing up on the beach
        It'll take more than the Angels or Iron Mike Tyson
        to heal this bloody breach, hey-hey

        You better hold on
        something's happening here
        You better hold on
        I'm gonna meet you in Tompkins Square

        A junkie ran down a lady, a pregnant dancer
        she'll never dance but the baby was saved
        He shot up some China White and nodded out at the wheel
        and he doesn't remember a thing
        They shot that old lady
        'cause they thought she was a witness
        to a crime she didn't even see
        Whose home is the home of the brave
        by the Statue of Bigotry, hey

        You better hold on
        something's happening here
        You better hold on
        there's a lie in Tompkins Square

        You got a black 38 and a gravity knife
        you still have to ride the train
        There's the smelly essence of New York down there
        but you ain't no Bernard Goetz, ah
        There's no mafia lawyer to fight in your corner
        for that 15 minutes of fame
        The have and the havenots are bleeding in the tub
        that's New York's future not mine, oh

        You better hold on
        something's happening here
        You better hold on
        hey baby, something's happening here
        Hold on, ooohhh babe

"Home Of The Brave"
========================
album _Legendary Hearts_
(Lou Reed, 1983)

written by Lou Reed
========================


        Here's to Johnny with his Jo
        and Mickey's got a wife
        And here's to Jerry
        he has got his Joyce

        And me, I'm shaking
        in my boots tonight
        For the daughters and the sons
        lost in the home of the brave

        And here's to the home of the brave
        And here's to the life that's not saved
        Here's to the home of the brave
        Here's to the home of the brave

        Here's to Frank hit in some bar
        in picturesque Brooklyn Heights
        And here's to a friend who jumped in front of a train
        at seven o'clock one night

        And another friend who thinks he lacks worth
        has disappeared from sight
        Somewhere in the home
        of the brave

        And here's to the home of the brave
        And here's to the life that's not saved
        Here's to the home of the brave
        Here's to the home of the brave

        The stars are hiding in their clouds
        the street lights are too bright
        A man's kicking a woman
        who's clutching his leg tight

        And I think suddenly of you
        and blink my eyes in fright
        And rush off to the home
        of the brave

        And here's to the home of the brave
        Here's to the home of the brave
        And here's to the life that is saved
        Here's to the home of the brave

        And everyday you have to die some
        cry some and die some
        And everyday you have to die some
        cry some and die

        In the home of the brave
        Home of the brave

"HookyWooky"
================================
album _Set The Twilight Reeling_
(Lou Reed, 1996)

written by Lou Reed
================================


        I'm standing with you on your roof
        looking at the chemical sky
        All purple blue and oranges
        some pigeons flying by
        The traffic on Canal Street's so noisy
        it's a shock
        And someone's shooting fireworks or a gun
        on the next block

        An-an-and, I wanna HookyWooky with you
        I wanna HookyWooky with you

        The traffic's so noisy it's a shock
        sounds like fireworks or a gun on the next block
        Ah, HookyWooky with you

        Your ex-lover Satchel is here from France
        yet another ex
        They gather about you like a Mother Superior
        all of you still friends, but -
        None of my old flames ever talk to me when things
        end for me they end
        They take your pants, your money, your name
        but the song still remains

        An-an-and, I wanna HookyWooky with you
        Ah-ha-ha-ha, I wanna HookyWooky with you

        Then they take your pants, your money, your name
        but the song still remains the same
        I wanna HookyWooky with you

        You're so civilized it hurts
        I guess I could learn a lot, ha-ha...
        About people, plants and relationships
        how not to get hurt a lot
        And each lover I meet up your roof
        I wouldn't want to throw him off, mmmm..
        Into the chemical sky, down into the streets to die
        under the wheels of a car on Canal Street
        And each lover I meet up on your roof
        I wouldn't want to throw him off, mmmm..
        Into the chemical sky
        under the wheels of a car to die on Canal street

        Ah-ah-hi, I wanna, ah, HookyWooky with you
        ah-huh, huh-huh-huh-ah
        I wanna HookyWooky with you

        I wouldn't want to throw him off into the chemical sky
        down into the streets to die
        Under the wheels of a car on Canal street

        Under the wheels of a car on Canal Street
        Under the wheels of a car on Canal Street
        HookyWooky
        Under the wheels of a car on Canal Street
        HookyWooky
        Under the wheels of a car on Canal Street
        Under the wheels of a car on Canal Street
        Hooky-Hooky-Hooky-Wooky

"Hopes On Hold"
================================
album _Nothing But The Truth_
(Ruben Blades, 1988)

written by Lou Reed/Ruben Blades
================================


        Trying to find out what to do with all your love
        Should I keep it out or let it in
        Can I trust in someone else for a lifetime
        And hope that the distance disappears

        'Cause everytime we place ourselves in other hands
        We take a chance by giving up control
        And second guessing, feeling starts to fade away
        And hopes on hold

        It's not easy to believe in someone else
        Don't know many people that are true
        Still I got to choose between my loneliness
        And that fear to trust in someone new

        'Cause everytime we place our faith in other hands
        We take a chance by giving up control
        But second guessing, feeling starts to fade away
        And hopes on hold

        Hopes on hold
        Hopes on hold

        Do you want to know the truth
        You shouldn't settle for a lie
        Am I just playing the fool
        Are you really what I want

        Everytime we place our faith in other hands
        We stand the chance those hands might let it fall
        But second guessing, feeling starts to run away
        And hopes on hold

        Hopes on hold
        Hopes on hold
        Hopes on hold
        Hopes on hold
        Hopes on hold
        Hopes on hold

Hopes on Hold (L. Reed-R.Blades);


lyrics:

trying to find out what to do with all your love
should i keep it out or let it in?
can i trust in someone else for a lifetime, and hope that
the distance disappears?
'cause everytime we place ourselves in other hands,
we take a chance by giving up control,
and second guessing, feeling starts to fade away and
hope's on hold

it's not easy to believe in someone else
don't know many people that are true.
still, i got to choose between my loneliness and fear
to trust in someone new.
'cause everytime we place our faith in other hands,
we take a chance by giving up control.
but, second, guessing, feeling starts to fade away and
hope's on hold

do you wanna know the truth?
you shouldn't settle for a lie
am i just playing the fool?
are you really what i want?

everytime we place our faith in other hands we stand
the chance those hands might let it fall,
but second guessing, feeling starts to run away and
hope's on hold.

"How Do You Speak To An Angel"
===================================
album _Growing Up In Public_
(Lou Reed, 1980)

written by Lou Reed/Michael Fonfara
===================================


        A son who is cursed with a harridan mother
        or a weak simpering father at best
        Is raised to play out the timeless classical motives
        of filial love and incest

        How does he speak to a
        how does he speak to the prettiest girl
        How does he talk to her
        What does he say for an opening line
        what does he say if he's shy

        What do you do with your pragmatic passions
        with your classically neurotic style
        How do you deal with your vague self-comprehension
        what do you do when you lie

        How do you speak to a
        how do you speak to the prettiest girl
        How do you speak to her
        How do you dance on the head of a pin
        when you're on the outside looking in

        How do you speak to a
        how do you speak to the prettiest girl
        How do you speak to a
        how do you speak to the prettiest girl

        How do you speak to a
        how do you speak to the prettiest girl
        How do you speak to a
        how do you speak to the prettiest girl

        How do you speak to a
        how do you speak to the prettiest girl
        How do you speak to a
        how do you speak to the prettiest girl
        You say, hello, baby
        ........ talk to the prettiest, prettiest girl
        Baby, angel
        how do you talk to the prettiest girl, you say -
        Hello baby, hello baby, angel-angel, pretty little girl
        Angel, angel ........ prettiest girl .......

"How Do You Think It Feels"
===========================
album _Berlin_
(Lou Reed, 1973)

written by Lou Reed
===========================


        How do you think it feels
        when you're speeding and lonely, come here baby
        How do you think it feels
        when all you can say is if only

        If only I had a little
        if only I had some change, come here baby
        If only, if only, only

        How do you think it feels
        and when do you think it stops

        How do you think it feels
        when you've been up for five days, come down here mama
        Hunting around always, ooohhh
        'cause you're afraid of sleeping

        How do you think it feels
        to feel like a wolf and foxy
        How do you think it feels

        To always make love by proxy, uh
        how do you think it feels
        And when do you think it stops
        when do you think it stops

"I'm Gonna Fight"


You want my girl
but i'm gonna fight
fight for her love
the love that i need
oh! i won't let her go

you want her bad
but i'm gonna fight 
yeah i'm gonna fight
she won't ...
the last...
...
...
but i know the kind of guy you are
so better stay away

i love that girl
so i'm gonna fight
i'm gonna fight
i won't let some fool
fool with my girl
oh you won't break her heart
i love that girl so much
so much that i wont' let anyone make her cry
i'm gonna fight
i'm gonna fight
i'm gonna fight 
yeah! i'm gonna fight
yeah! i'm gonna fight
 
(fade out)


---------------------------------------------------------------------

I send you a lyrics update for the pre-velvet songs.
i paid attention and i could fill more gaps,
i could complete some more gaps.



i'm gonna fight


she won't get hurt
hurt from the last

if i'd know that you would treat her blue
i...stand in your way

written by Moe Tucker

Lou Reed: lead guitar
============================================


        I'm not workin' hard
        I'm just foolin' around
        My feet's in the stars
        my head's on the ground

        I'm not doin' very much
        floppin' on the couch
        And I'm not gettin' anywhere
        layin' round the house

        Another day is runnin' by
        And I'm still sittin' here
        I used to have a decay
        Now it's just a ...

        I'm not thinkin' very fast
        starin' at the tube
        I don't think I'm gonna last
        if this is all I do

        I think I need a job
        stop, stop sleeping in my walk
        I know I need to get smart
        don't listen to their talk

        I think I'm slowly drainin'
        Like a bathtub with leak
        I don't know which way is up
        I just can't seem to think

        I'm not foolin' anyone
        maybe just myself
        'Cause I'm not having any fun
        sittin' on the shelf

        Another day is runnin' by

        If you think that it's so good
        you know what you'll have to do
        You're walkin' down 5th Avenue
        you're seein' things that aren't true
        Without you come and wait me
        you're not a hesitating, here it comes

        I'm not too sorry
        now that you're gone
        I don't think I'll miss you
        I found a new one

        If you know that it's not right
        hey, I'll see you some other night
        But if you want it when you're gone
        you'll find yourself another one
        So now, okay
        worry, it's around, oh-oh

        I'm not too sorry
        that you're gone
        I don't think I'm sorry
        'cause I found a new one
        It wouldn't break my heart
        it wouldn't make it hard to go around

"I'm Set Free"
==============================
album _The Velvet Underground_
(The Velvet Underground, 1969)

written by Lou Reed
==============================


        I've been set free and I've been bound
        To the memories of yesterday's clowns
        I've been set free and I've been bound
        and now

        I'm set free
        I'm set free
        I'm set free to find a new illusion

        I've been blinded but now I can see
        What in the world has happened to me
        The prince of stories who walks right by me
        and now

        I'm set free
        I'm set free
        I'm set free to find a new illusion

        I've been set free and I've been bound
        Let me tell you people what I've found
        I saw my head laughing, rolling on the ground
        and now

        I'm set free
        I'm set free
        I'm set free to find a new illusion

        Well I've been set free and I've been bound

        Yes, I am mother nature's son
        and I'm the only one
        I do what I want and I want what I see
        huh, could only happen to me

        I'm so free
        I'm so free

        Oh please, Saint Germaine
        I have come this way
        Do you remember the shape I was in
        I had horns and fins

        I'm so free
        I'm so free

        Do you remember the silver walks
        you used to shiver and I used to talk
        Then we went down to Times Square
        and ever since I've been hangin' round there

        I'm so free
        I'm so free

        Yes, I am mother nature's son
        and I'm the only one
        I do what I want and I want what I see
        could only happen to me

        I'm so free
        I'm so free

        Oh-oh-oh, I'm so free
        oh-oh-oh, I'm so free
        Oh-oh-oh, I'm so free
        early in the morning, I'm so free
        Late in the evening, I'm so free
        yeah-yeah-yeah, I'm so free
        When I feel good, I'm so free
        when it's in the morning, I'm so free
        When it's in the evening, I'm so free
        I'm so free, I'm so free
        I'm so free, I'm so free
        feel so good now, I'm so free
        Oh-oh-oh, I'm so free
        yeah-yeah-yeah, I'm so free
        Oh-oh-oh, I'm so free
        feel so good now, I'm so free
        Feel little nice, I'm so free
        feel little down now, I'm so free
        You're so free, I'm so free
        I'm so free, I'm so free
        I'm so free, I'm so free
        I'm so free, I'm so free

        I'm sticking with you
        'cause I'm made out of glue
        Anything that you might do
        I'm gonna do, too

        You held up a stagecoach in the rain
        and I'm doing the same
        Saw you hanging from a tree
        and I made believe it was me

        I'm sticking with you

        Anything that you might do
        I'm gonna do, too

        Moon people going to the stratosphere
        soldiers fighting with the Cong
        But with you by my side I can do anything
        when we swing, we hang past right and wrong

        I'll do anything for you
        anything you'd want me to
        I'll do anything for you, oh wow
        I'm sticking with you, oh wow

I hope I can help improve the little details that can be improved;
I've found an error in the lyrics for "I'm sticking with you"...
Im pretty certain that the words are:


"There're people going into the stratosphere
Soldiers fighting with the Cong"


"The Cong" being slang for the Vietnamese army in the Vietnam war.
Hope this helped!

"I'm Waiting For The Man"
=======================================
album _The Velvet Underground and Nico_
(The Velvet Underground, 1967)

written by Lou Reed
=======================================


        I'm waiting for my man
        26 dollars in my hand
        Up to Lexington 125
        feelin' sick and dirty more dead than alive
        I'm waiting for my man

        Hey white boy, what you doin' uptown
        Hey white boy, you chasin' our women around
        Oh pardon me sir, it's furthest from my mind
        I'm just lookin' for a dear dear friend of mine
        I'm waiting for my man

        Here he comes, he's all dressed in black
        PR shoes and a big straw hat
        He's never early, he's always late
        first thing you learn is that you always gotta wait
        I'm waiting for my man, ah, work it now

        Up to a brownstone, up three flights of stairs
        Everybody-body's pinned you, but nobody cares
        He's got the works, gives you sweet taste
        ah, then you gotta split because you got no time to waste
        I'm waiting for my man

        Baby don't you holler, darling don't you ball and shout
        I'm feeling good, you know I'm gonna work it on out
        I'm feeling good, I'm feelin' oh so fine
        until tomorrow but that's just some other time
        I'm waiting for my man, walk it home

        Hey boy, what you doin' uptown
        Hey now boy, you chasin' our women around

        Oh now everybody's pinned you, baby, but nobody cares
        He's got the works, gives you sweet taste
        then you gotta split because you got no time to waste
        I'm waiting for my man

        Hey now baby don't you holler, don't you ball and shout
        Oh, you know I'm feeling good, I'm gonna work it on out
        I'm feeling good, I'm feeling so fine
        until tomorrow but that's just some other time
        I'm waiting for my man, hey, now-now

===============================


        I'm waiting for the man
        26 dollars in my hand
        Up to Lexington 125
        feelin' sick and dirty more dead than alive
        I'm waiting for the man

        Hey white boy, what you doing uptown
        Hey white boy, you chasing our women around
        Oh pardon me sir, nothing could be further from my mind
        I'm just waiting for a really good friend of mine
        I'm waiting for the man

        Here he comes, he's all dressed in black
        PR shoes and a big straw hat
        He's never early, he's always late
        first thing you learn is that you always gotta wait
        I'm waiting for the man

        Up to a brownstone, up three flights of stairs
        Everybody's pinned you, but nobody cares
        He's got the works, he gives you sweet taste
        then you gotta split because you got no time to waste
        I'm waiting for the man

        Baby don't you holler, darling don't you ball and shout
        I'm feeling good and, no, we'll work it on out
        I'm feeling good, I'm feeling real fine
        until tomorrow but that's just some other time
        I'm waiting for the man

"I'm Waiting For The Man"


Hey, Here he comes, he's dressed in black chima

He's never early, all the time he shows up late aah
I have to leave says
I'm waiting for my man, I'm working at it

Go up to a Brownstone, up three flights of stairs

Aha I sing when you shut up
Right now you got it
That's where it is
That's right that's not me that's life

"Rock n' roll heart"

Jesus

Everybody's pinned you, but nobody cares
He's got his works, he's gonna lay it on your little taste
That you told me so good but ain't had any time to waste
So he's gotta go says baby come on ooh don't you know says
Waiting for my man
Bye bye

Hey Baby, don't you bawl and shout

Don't bring me down
I'm feeling so good, I'm feeling so good
I I I work it on out
Because I'm feeling so good, I'm feeling so fine
Until tomorrow, but babe that's just some other time
I'm I'm I'm waiting for my man
Oh baby baby I'm waiting for my man
Says now, hey, bitch you gotta get out here quick

Why don't you split the scene you gonna make me sick
I never said...
You read too many movies baby you get too many college plays
Oh baby don't know where you got those bad things
Don't you like things
Why don't you leave them this way
This representation's not my game
Ooh I'm waiting for my man

It's just a temporary thing

Hey, the bitch
Nobody don't you know you better get out her quick
Gonna make me sick
Read too many movies and you've seen too many plays
And nobody's got you tied down the fucking bed man
If you don't like it around you just get the fuck away
I'm on the top of the world today honey I don't need you nobody
And don't you bring me down
It's just a temporary thing man I know
Last time it's too expensive to waste
You went through all that you want to throw it away?
You gotta be kidding
I know it's not anything personal but
Would you right
Ah cigarettes
Your mother your father your cocksucking brother
Mean only the shit to me
And now know that we don't see things much the same way
I don't get the shits about your mother
Just get them away

We'll let just things stay that way over there
'Cause babe, babe, babe, baby
It's just a temporary thing

Hey, babe, huhh don't you know
It's just a temporary thing
Your blood's too rich
You're catholic too
Wasting guilt man
Every shit yeh
Tarot cards
I don't care
Read your palm on Thursday
Middle-class fuckup
So what
Wanna get off
No work tomorrow
You watch TV is more fun
Huh says now I'm waiting for my man
Be here keep me here either now or never
So it's never man
What you hear is now
Very funny thing about that
You wanna have it I don't have it
I never figured out
You know my friend Michael he said something very very funny
That night
He said you know this isn't fun anymore
I mean he was joking you know
Cause he was like ah
It was all fucking day after night
The fucking asshole gets stuck in a taxi
He's straight, he wasn't burning anybody
Was full moon
Triple scorpio
Fucking sitting here dripping man
Getting the asshole
It's like fucking cold
Get over there bitch
Gotta better
Get outta here quick
Oh baby don't you know my .. is sick
I don't wanna hear about it
Cause if you can say nothing good
Why don't you just get the fuck out of the door
You know what Groucho Marx said
Groucho Marx said hey man this song
Bring me a rose or leave me alone
Either up or go
Man I don't wanna know about it
Tomorrow
Oh baby don't you holler don't you bawl and shout
Oh babe it's just a temporary thing

"I'm Waiting For My Man"
(_Take_No_Prisoners_)


Hey hey come guys
just about ....
Can't tell me he's be there
He's never early, all the time he shows up late, oh
Spend half my, if i have to, week
Says I'm waiting for my man
Go up to a Brownstone, up three flights of stairs

Ah, I sing when you shut up
Right, now you got it, that's where it is, that's right
That's me, that's not life, Jezus

Everybody's pinned, but nobody cares
She's gotta said the works,
she's gonna lay it on your little taste
that she told so good, but he ain't had any time to waste
so he's gotta go, says: Baby come on,
Ooooo, don't you know somebody else is waiting for the man
Bye bye

Hey baby don't you bawl and shout
Don't bring me down
I feel so good
I feel so good, and I ah
wah, I'm working on out
Because I'm feeling so good
Ha, I'm feeling so fine
Until tomorrow, but babe
haha, that's just some other time
I, I, I'm waiting for my man

Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, I'm waiting for my man
Says now: hey bitch you better get out of here quick
(I'm waiting for my man)

Why don't you split if the scene around here is gonna make you sick
I never said the ....
You read to many movies baby, but, too many of you college players

Ooohhh baby
Don't know where you got your ideas about things
If you don't like things, why don't you just leave them this way
This representation is not my game
I, I'm waiting for my man

It's just a temporary thing

Hey there bitch
Don't you know you better get out of here quick
And if the scene around here is gonna, gonna, gonna make you sick
You read to many movies and you've seen too many players
And nobody has got you tied down the fucking bed
Man, if you don't like it around here, you just get the fuck away
I'm on top of the world today honey,
I don't need you, nobody, and don't you bring me down
It's just a temporary thing, man, I know
Last time we got and it's too expensive to waste
After you went through all that, you wanna throw it away?
You gotta be kiddin'
I know it's not anything personally, would you right?
Ah, cigarette
Your mother, your father and your cocksucking brother
man, they don't mean shit to me
And I know that we don't see things much the same way
I don't guess you should value always your fathers your mother
your bitch praying boy, just keep them away
We'll just let things stay that way,
over there, you keep it over there
'Cause babe, babe, babe, babe, babe,
it's just a temporaly thing
(it's just a temporaly thing)
(it's just a temporaly thing)
(it's just a temporaly thing)

Hey babe, uhuh, don't you know it's just a temporaly thing
Your blood is too rich, you're catholic too
Western guilt man, every shit
Hey, tarot cards, I don't care man
Richard Carmichael at thursday
Middle class fucker, so what
You want to get off?
Hey ...
No work tomorrow
Will you watch TV, it's more fun
(it's just a temporaly thing)
Huh, says the
I'm waiting for my man
Be here, keep me here, either now or never
It's allways never man, even when it's here it's never
Very funny thing about that, it's allways,
you gonna have it, I don't have it
I never figured out
You know, my friend Michael,
he said to me something very very funny, the other night,
he says: you know, this, this isn't fun anymore
I meant he was choking, you know, 'cause he's like that
(it's just a temporaly thing)
But it was all fucking day, half the night, man,
the fucking asshole got stuck at a taxi
I thought I'd hit
He was straight, he wasn't burning anybody,
(it's just a temporaly thing)
Full moon, triple scorpio, aha
Now the fucking city ain't tripping man, gimmie out an asshole
(it's just a temporaly thing)
Yeah, yeah, it's like fucking cold
Get over there bitch,
we're goin' to bed
........ get out of here quick
Ooohhh baby, baby, don't you know I'm afraid
half thing of my age is sick
(it's just a temporaly thing)
I don't wanna hear about it anymore
(it's just a temporaly thing)
Because if you can't say love is good,
(it's just a temporaly thing)
Why don't you just get the fuck out of the door
You know what Groucho Marx said?
Groucho Marx said: Hey man, the best song
Bring me a rose, or leave me alone
Either up or go man I don't wanna know about it
Tomorrow, aahh baby, don't you holler, don't you bawl and shout
Ooooo babe, it's just a temporary thing

The B chord in "I'm Wating for the Man" should be  F#.
(album _The Velvet Underground and Nico_ version)

It would seem that, semantically speaking,
the word "ball" in the lyric
"Baby don't you holler, baby don't you ball and shout"
should actually be "bawl,"

as in:
"Baby don't you holler, baby don't you bawl and shout."

It's not a mystery, no .....

"I Believe"
=============================
album _Songs For Drella_
(Lou Reed/John Cale, 1990)

written by Lou Reed/John Cale
=============================


        Valerie Solanis took the elevator
        got off at the 4th floor
        Valerie Solanis took the elevator
        got off at the 4th floor
        She pointed the gun at Andy
        saying you cannot control me anymore

        I believe
        there's got to be some retribution
        I believe
        an eye for an eye is elemental
        I believe
        there's something wrong if she's alive right now

        Valerie Solanis took three steps
        pointing at the floor
        Valerie Solanis waved her gun
        pointing at the floor
        From inside her idiot madness spoke and bang
        Andy fell onto the floor

        I believe
        life's serious enough for retribution
        I believe
        being sick is no excuse and
        I believe
        I would've pulled the switch on her myself

        When they got him to the hospital his pulse was gone
        they thought that he was dead
        His guts were pouring from his wounds onto the floor
        they thought that he was dead
        Not until years later would the hospital do to him
        what she could not, what she could not

        "Where were you
        you didn't come to see me"
        Andy said
        "I think I died, why didn't you come to see me"
        Andy said
        "It hurt so much, they took blood from my hand"

        I believe
        there's got to be some retribution
        I believe
        there's got to be some restitution
        I believe
        we are all the poorer for it now

        Visit me, visit me
        Visit me, visit me
        Visit me, why didn't you visit me
        visit me, why didn't you visit me
        Visit me, visit me
        visit me, why didn't you visit me

"I Don't Need This"
==============================================
from the play _Time Rocker_
(Robert Wilson/Darryl Pinckney/Lou Reed, 1996)

written by Lou Reed

performed by actors, German musicians

Jun 11, 1996
Thalia Theater, Hamburg, Germany
(pre-premiere)
==============================================


        I don't need this
        don't care about it, I don't feel this
        Don't care about it, if I'm hungry
        then I am eating, if I'm lazy
        Then I am sleeping, I don't need this
        don't care about it, in two years
        I'll be retiring, don't feel good
        don't feel sad, don't get angry
        I don't get mad and I don't go up
        I don't go down, I don't need this
        Don't care about it

        Some like moonlights
        gay sonatas, I'd like to get out
        Persona non grata, move out
        with nothing with me, no hair upon my head
        If it is chilly, no clothing
        no extra money, no children
        No extra honey, no mistress
        no little chocolate, no chokes and sobs
        I want to get out, I want to get out
        I want to get out

        I don't need it



        [dialogue in German with "Spine Music" instrumental]



        I don't need this

        I don't need this
        don't care about it, I don't feel this
        Don't care about it, if I'm hungry

        Then I am sleeping, ah

        I don't need this
        don't care about it, in two years old
        I'll be retiring, don't feel good
        don't feel sad, don't get angry
        I don't get mad, don't go up
        I don't go down, I don't need this
        Don't care about it

        Some like moonlights
        gay sonatas, I'd like to get out
        Persona non grata, move out
        with nothing with me, no hair upon my head
        If it is chilly, no clothing
        no extra money, no children
        No extra honey, no mistress
        no little chocolate, no chokes and sobs

        I want to get out
        I want to get out
        I want to get out

        I don't need it

        I found a reason to keep singin'
        Wow-woh, and the reason dear is you

        And you know the reason dear it's you
        And I've walked down life's lonely highways
        hand in hand with myself
        And I realize
        how many paths have crossed between us

        Oh, I do believe
        you are what you perceive
        What comes is better than what
        came before

"I Found Her"

album _Nils_
(Nils Lofgren, 1979)

written by Nils Lofgren/Lou Reed
================================


        Hidin' underneath the rock, she was, she was
        that me tell you all messed up
        Takin' dog very sick
        almost dead and very crazy
        You took a lot of help from me
        together up and going

        I found her, so keep that in your mind
        when you kiss her, I hope you understand
        How I miss her and how I'm the man
        who found her

        Not so really long ago
        told her everything she knows
        And I was out me, she really -
        - can exist all
        I made her like God
        I cannot make her just as well

        I found her, so keep that in your mind
        when you kiss her, I hope you understand
        How I miss her and how I'm the man
        who found her

        Hidin' underneath the rock, she was, she was
        that me tell you all messed up
        Takin' dog very sick
        almost dead and very crazy
        You took a lot of help from me
        together up and going

        I found her, so keep that in your mind
        when you kiss her, I hope you understand
        How I miss her and how I'm the man
        who found her

        I found her, so keep that in your mind
        when you kiss her, I hope you understand

        I've got a tiger in my tank

        I've got a '55 Shelby with a station six
        I'm tellin' you waitin' we don't mix
        So when I go straight out from the line
        now me and my Shelby ring out fine
        Cause -

        I've got a tiger in my tank
        And there's a lion at the wheel

        And I can really move (ooohhh-ooohhh-ooohhh-ooohhh-ooohhh)
        and I can really move (ooohhh-ooohhh-ooohhh-ooohhh-ooohhh)
        And I can really move

        I've got a tiger in my tank

        There are guys who got money and blue suede class
        but I've got somethin' that's a guess

        there is any guy that can't take me

written by Lou Reed
==============================


        Here comes countdown
        she's gone-gone-gone
        Ready-ready-ready-ready-ready
        got my eyes wide open

        Ever since I was on crippled Monday, ah
        got my eyeballs on my knees, ah baby, walkin'
        I rapped for hours with Mad Mary Williams
        she said she never understood a word from me, because -

        I know that she cares about me
        I heard her call my name
        And I know she's long dead and gone
        still it ain't the same
        Oh, when I wake up in the morning, mama
        I heard her call my name
        I know she's dead and long far gone
        I heard her call my name
        and then I felt my mind split open

        Here comes countdown
        it's gone-gone-gone
        Ready-ready-ready-ready-ready
        got my eyes wide open

        Ever since I was on crippled Monday
        got my eyeballs on my knees
        I rapped for hours with Mad Mary Williams
        she said she never understood a word from me, oh

        I know she cares about me
        I heard her call my name, walkin' baby now
        I said that she's long dead and gone
        still she ain't the same ....
        Oh, when I wake up in the morning, mama

Jun 1993
L'Olympia, Paris, France
==============================


        Ever since I was on cripple Monday
        got my eyeballs on my knee
        I rapped for hours with Mad Mary Williams
        never ever said a word to me, because -

        I know that she cares about me
        I heard her call my name
        I know that she's long dead and gone
        but still it ain't the same
        Early in the morning, mum
        I heard her call my name
        I know that she's long dead and gone
        but it ain't the same

        Ever since I was on cripple Monday
        got my eyeballs on my knees, hey baby, walkin'
        Rapped for hours with ah Henry
        never said a word to me, because -

        I know that she cares about me
        I heard her call my name
        And I know that she's long dead and gone
        but it still ain't the same
        When I wake up in the morning, mum
        I heard her call my name
        I know that she's long dead and gone
        I heard her call my name, my mind split open

"I Love You"

album _Lou Reed_
(Lou Reed, 1972)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        When I think of all the things I've done
        and I know that it's only just begun
        Those smiling faces, you know I just can't forget 'em
        but I love you

        When I think of all the things I've seen
        and I know that it's only the beginning
        You know those smiling faces, I just can't forget 'em
        but for now, I love you

        Just for a little while
        oh baby, just to see you smile
        Just for a little while

        When I think of all those things I've done
        and I know that it's only just begun
        Oh, smiling faces, Jesus, you know I can't forget 'em
        But for now, I love you
        right this minute, baby now
        I love you
        at least for now, I love you

"I Love You, Suzanne"

album _New Sensations_
(Lou Reed, 1984)

written by Lou Reed
======================


        You broke my heart and you made me cry
        you said that I couldn't dance
        But now I'm back to let you know
        that I can really make romance

        You do what you gotta do
        you do everything you can
        You do what you wanna do
        hey, but I love you, Suzanne

        You do anything once
        you try anything twice

===================================


        They say every man he needs protection
        they say every man must fall
        Yet I swear I see my reflection, mmmm..
        where so high above the wall

        I see my light come shining
        from the west unto the east
        Any day now, any way now
        I shall be released

        They say everything can be replaced
        yet every distance is not near
        So I remember every face
        of every man who put me here

        I see my light come shining
        from the west unto the east
        Any day now, any way now
        I shall be released

        Wow-wow-wow-woh
        wow-wow-wow-woh
        Wow-wow-wow-woh
        wow-wow-wow-woh

        Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
        there's a man who swears he not to blame
        All day long I hear him scream so loud
        screaming out that he's been framed

        I see my light come shining
        from the west unto the east
        Any day now, any way now
        I shall be released

        Wow-wow-wow-woh
        wow-wow-wow-woh
        Wow-wow-wow-woh
        wow-wow-wow-woh

Lou:    THEY SAY EVERY MAN NEEDS PROTECTION
        THEY SAY EVERY MAN MUST FALL
        Yet I swear I see my reflection
        somewhere so high above the wall

        I see my light come shining
        from the west unto the east
        Any day now, any way now
        I shall be released

        Wow-wow-wow-woh
        wow-wow-wow-woh
        Wow-wow-wow-woh
        wow-wow-wow-woh

        I woke up this morning, and ..... the shining lights ...
        you .......... never-never-never ........
        I said I woke up this morning ..... shining so bright, yeah
        ..............

        I see my light come shining
        from the west unto the east
        Any day now, any way now

        wow-wow-wow-woh
        Wow-wow-wow-woh
        wow-wow-wow-woh

        I shall be, I shall be
        I shall be released, mmmm..
        I shall be, They shall be
        They shall be released, mmmm..
        They shall be, They shall be
        They shall be released
        They shall be, They shall be
        They shall be released
        They shall be, They shall be
        They shall be released

"I Still Believe In You"
========================================
album _I Still Believe In You_
(Vince Gill, 1992)

written by Vince Gill/John Barlow Jarvis

Lou Reed: background vocals (?)
========================================


        Everybody wants a little piece of my time
        but still I put you at the end of the line
        How it breaks my heart to cause you this pain
        to see the tears you cry fallin' like rain

        Give me the chance to prove
        and I'll make it up to you

        I still believe in you
        with a love that will always be
        Standing so strong and true
        baby, I still believe in you and me

        Somewhere along the way, I guess I just lost track
        only thinkin' of myself never lookin' back
        For all the times I've hurt you, I apologize
        I'm sorry it took so long to finally realize

        Give me the chance to prove
        that nothing's worth losing you

        I still believe in you
        with a love that will always be
        Standing so strong and true
        baby, I still believe in you and me

        Baby, I still believe in you
        with a love that will always be
        Standing so strong and true
        baby, I still believe in you and me

There's a couple of errors that may be related to cultural
clues and slang... here's a better version, done from memory.
I haven't listened to this song for a few years but
trust me on this-this makes a lot more sense.
I've edited down the "Yeahs" and "oh ohs" for clarity.



"I Wanna Be Black"


I wanna be black,
have natural rhythm
Shoot twenty foot of jism too
and fuck up the jews

I wanna be black,
I wanna be a panther
Have a girlfriend named Samantha
and have a stable of foxy whores
Oh, oh, I wanna be black 

I don't wanna be a fucked up middle class college student no more
I just wanna have a stable of foxy little whores

Yeah, yeah, I wanna be black
Oh, oh, I wanna be black
Yeah, yeah, I wanna be black

I wanna be black,
I wanna be like Martin Luther King
And get myself shot in spring
And lead a whole generation, too
and fuck up the jews

I wanna be black, 
I wanna be like Malcolm X
And pass the hex
over President Kennedy's tomb
And have a big prick, too

Oh, I don't wanna be a fucked up
middle class college student no more
Yeah, I just wanna have a stable of foxy little whores

Yeah, yeah, I wanna be black (repeat)

"I Wanna Know (The Pit And The Pendulum)"
==============================================
album _The Raven_
(Lou Reed, 2003)

written by Lou Reed

sung by Lou Reed and The Blind Boys Of Alabama
==============================================


        Under the intense scrutiny of Ligeia's eyes
        I have felt the full knowledge
        And force of their expression
        And yet been unable to possess it
        And have felt it leave me
        As so many other things have left
        The letter half-read
        The bottle half-drunk
        Finding
        Finding in the commonest objects of the universe
        A circle of analogies
        Of metaphors
        Ooohhh
        For that expression
        Which has been willfully
        withheld from me
        The access to the inner soul denied

        I wanna know, ooohhh
        I wanna know
        I wanna know, oh
        I wanna know

        In consideration
        In consideration of the faculties and impulses
        Of the human soul
        Of the human soul
        In consideration
        Of our arrogance
        Of our arrogance
        Our radical, primitive irreducible arrogance of reason
        We have all overlooked the propensity
        We saw no need for it
        The paradoxical something which we may call perverseness
        Perverseness
        Through its promptings we act without
        Comprehensible object
        We act for the reason we should not
        We act for the reason we should not
        For certain minds this is absolutely irre-, irre-
        irresistible
        irresistible
        The conviction of the wrong
        Or impolicy of an action
        Is often the unconquerable force
        The unconquerable force
        It is a primitive impulse
        It is a primitive impulse
        Primitive impulse
        The overwhelming tendency
        The overwhelming tendency to do
        Wrong for the wrong's sake
        To do wrong for the wrong's sake
        We persist in acts
        Because we feel that we
        should not persist in them
        Because we feel we, feel we
        should not persist, per-, persist in them, ah
        Ooohhh

        So I wanna know
        I wanna know
        I wanna know
        I wanna know

        I wanna, I wanna know
        I wanna, I
        Ooohhh, we persist in action
        We persist in action
        Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong
        Ooohhh
        Wrong, wrong
        Oh we persist in action
        Ah yeah yeah
        When you know that it's wrong

"I Want To Boogie With You"
===================================
album _The Bells_
(Lou Reed, 1979)

written by Lou Reed/Michael Fonfara
===================================


        Hey pretty baby
        don't you think you might give me a chance
        Get it on with me
        go downtown for some love and romance
        And I know I ain't nothing
        I ain't worth but a thin dime
        But if you put your heart in my hands
        I'm sure that I could change your mind

        I wanna boogie with you
        Yeah, I wanna boogie with you

        And there's something, baby that your parents
        both agreed
        And that is that they both had it
        a big distrust in me
        And your best friend Frankie
        I know your best friend Frankie wants to see me sink
        And I don't much blame him for that
        he gets so useless after so few drinks

        You know babe, I wanna boogie with you
        I wanna boogie with you

        And I know your little baby sister
        she thinks that I'm a flop
        But I guess that you know that it's true
        I spent more time on the bottom than the top
        Tell your little sister
        I know she wants to give me a whirl
        But I don't have the time
        babe, wait till she's grown up and she's a woman, not a girl

        Don't you know I want to boogie with you
        Hey, I want to boogie with you
        I wanna boogie with you
        I wanna boogie with you, yeah

        Boogie with you
        Down on the corner
        boogie with you, yeah

"I'll Be Your Mirror"
=======================================
album _The Velvet Underground and Nico_
(The Velvet Underground, 1967)

written by Lou Reed
=======================================


        I'll be your mirror
        reflect what you are, in case you don't know
        I'll be the wind, the rain and the sunset
        the light on your door to show that you're home

        When you think the night has seen your mind
        that inside you're twisted and unkind
        Let me stand to show that you are blind
        Please put down your hands
        'cause I see you

        I find it hard
        to believe you don't know, the beauty you are
        But if you don't, let me be your eyes
        a hand to your darkness, so you won't be afraid

        When you think the night has seen your mind
        that inside you're twisted and unkind
        Let me stand to show that you are blind
        Please put down your hands
        'cause I see you

        I'll be your mirror (reflect what you are)
        I'll be your mirror (reflect what you are)
        I'll be your mirror (reflect what you are)
        I'll be your mirror (reflect what you are)
        I'll be your mirror (reflect what you are)

"I'll Be Your Mirror"
===============================
album _Le Bataclan '72_
(Lou Reed/John Cale/Nico, 2003)

Jan 29, 1972
Le Bataclan, Paris, France
===============================


        I'll be your mirror
        reflect what you are, in case you don't know
        I'll be the wind, the rain and the sunset
        the light on your door to show that you're home

        When you think the night has seen your mind
        and inside you're twisted and unkind
        Let me stand to show that you are blind
        Please put down your hands
        'cause I see you

        I find it hard
        to believe you don't know, the beauty you are
        But if you don't, let me be your eyes
        a hand to your darkness, so you won't be afraid

        When you think the night has seen your mind
        and inside you're twisted and unkind
        Let me stand to show that you are blind
        Please put down your hands
        'cause I see you

        I'll be your mirror (reflect what you are)
        I'll be your mirror (reflect what you are)
        I'll be your mirror (reflect what you are)
        I'll be your mirror (reflect what you are)

"I'll Be Your Mirror"
(acetate version)
===================================================
album _The Velvet Underground and Nico - Unripened_
(The Velvet Underground, 2007)
===================================================


        I'll be your mirror
        reflect what you are, in case you don't know
        I'll be the wind, the rain and the sunset
        the light on your door to show that you're home

        When you think the night has seen your mind
        that inside you're twisted and unkind
        Let me stand to show that you are blind
        Please put down your hands
        'cause I see you

        I find it hard
        to believe you don't know, the beauty you are
        But if you don't, let me be your eyes
        a hand to your darkness, to show that you're home

        When you think the night has seen your mind
        that inside you're twisted and unkind
        Let me stand to show that you are blind
        Please put down your hands
        'cause I see you

        I'll be your mirror (reflect what you are)
        I'll be your mirror (reflect what you are)
        I'll be your mirror (reflect what you are)
        I'll be your mirror (reflect what you are)




        Olivier Landemaine's The VU Web Page says:<em>
        I'll Be Your Mirror is possibly the same take,
        but with alternate Nico vocal track.
        Nico ends second verse with "to show that you're home"
        instead of "so you won't be afraid",
        and it has quieter "reflect what you are" backing vocals
        at the end.</em>

"I'll Keep It With Mine"
=======================================
unreleased live
(The Velvet Underground, 1966)

written by Bob Dylan

Feb 06, 1966
Film Makers Cinematheque, New York City
=======================================


        You'll search, babe
        at any cost
        But how long, babe
        can you search for what's not lost

        Everybody will help you
        Some people are very kind
        But if I can save you any time

        Come on, give it to me
        I'll keep it with mine

        I can't help it
        if you might think I am odd
        If I say I'm not loving you for what you are
        but for what you're not

        Everybody will help you
        Discover what you set out to find
        But if I can save you any time

        Come on, give it to me
        I'll keep it with mine

        The train leaves
        at half past ten
        But it'll be back
        tomorrow same time again

        The conductor, he's weary
        still stuck on the line

"Images"
=============================
album _Songs For Drella_
(Lou Reed/John Cale, 1990)

written by Lou Reed/John Cale
=============================


        I think images are worth repeating
        images repeated from a painting
        Images taken from a painting
        from a photo worth re-seeing

        I love images worth repeating
        project them upon the ceiling
        multiply them with silk screening
        see them with a different feeling

        Images, those images
        images, those images

        Some say images have no feeling
        I think there's a deeper meaning
        Mechanical precision or so it's seeming
        instigates a cooler feeling

        I love multiplicity of screenings
        things born anew display new meanings
        I think images are worth repeating
        and repeating and repeating

        Images, oh images
        those images, images

        I'm no urban idiot savant
        spewing paint without any order
        I'm no sphinx, no mystery enigma
        what I paint is very ordinary

        I don't think I'm old or modern
        I don't think I think I'm thinking
        it doesn't matter what I am thinking
        it's images are worth repeating

        And repeating, those images
        images

        If you're looking for a deeper meaning
        I'm as deep as this high ceiling
        If you think technique is meaning
        you might find me very simple

        You might think the images are boring
        cars and cans and chairs and flowers
        and you might find me personally boring
        Hammer, sickle, Mao Tse Tong

        Mao Tse Tong
        those images, those images
        Images

        I think that it bears repeating
        the images upon the ceiling
        I love images worth repeating
        and repeating and repeating

        Images, images
        those images, those images

student:

        Two marble balls in a sack
        one long and slender candle
        one mouth
        two reckonings
        Consternation and treachery

        I am drawn to do what I should not

        Guilty, guilty, guilty guilty
        no, no, never never no
        seven mornings
        thirteen moons
        five wolves
        one silk spread morning
        seven bells for seven senses
        each one lusting lusting



student:

        Guiltily



teacher:

        Two milk fed glands ripe and red tipped
        Are you listening my little mouse
        Each sense ripped from its bodice
        each gland primed to its overflow
        Do you hear me my little mouse man
        Do you hear me little cock



student:

        Semen



teacher:

        Are you listening
        My little tumescence smear

        Ligeia
        I stand on the edge and am drawn to it
        Guilt
        I am shadow

album _The Raven_
(Lou Reed, 2003)

written by Lou Reed
=====================


        In the science of the mind
        there is no forgiving
        Paralyzed I lay here sleeping
        quiet as a little child

        Heart starts beating, blood rushing pounding
        moving quiet as a little lamb
        In the science of the mind
        limbs are bound devoid of movement

        The injuries we do in kind
        are visited upon us often
        In the science of the mind
        trying hard to move a shadow

        Don't bury me I'm still alive
        the science of the mind unyielding
        The science of the mind unyielding
        the science of the mind unyielding

        You're so impressed
        oh, with the figures and the facts
        You're so impressed
        oh, with the latest style

        You tried your best, but you can't relax
        you won't slow down before you take it to the max

        'Cause you're innocent, not guilty
        innocent, we'll let you go this time
        You're innocent, not guilty

        You're so confused
        with what comes up next
        You're so confused
        and you're so complex

        You're so amused when you're in the mood
        when it comes to sex, you're using your special effects

        'Cause you're innocent, not guilty
        innocent, we'll let you go this time
        You're innocent, not guilty

        You don't need no jury
        you don't need no trial
        We won't take no chances
        we're gonna ruin all the records in the fingerprint file

        You're innocent, not guilty
        innocent, not guilty
        Innocent, not guilty
        innocent, we'll let you go this time

        (somebody shut the door)

        I know where temptation lies
        inside of you heart
        (you can talk during this)
        I know where the evil lies
        inside of your heart
        (well get out of here)

        If you're gonna try to make it right
        you're surely gonna end up wrong
        (wrong-wrong-wrong-wrong)

        (oh, shut the door)
        (ah)
        (that's the only chord I know)

        I know where the mirror's edge
        is inside of your heart
        (I'll bet she didn't pay a dollar for it)
        I know where the razor's edge
        is inside of your heart
        (Motown)
        (it's no even within five feet)

        Well if you're gonna make it right
        you're surely gonna end up wrong
        (you don't look like Martha and the Vandellas)
        (oh, I'm just gonna start it all over again
        somebody get her out of here)
        (electricity comes from other planets)

        (yes I can)
        (I can talk to myself this way)
        (I'll lock the door this time)

        I know where temptation lies
        inside of your heart
        (yes, he's ready)
        I know where the evil lies
        inside of your heart
        (is he ready)

        Well if you're gonna try to make it right
        your surely gonna end up wrong

        (oh, the hole mess start again)
        (well New York buildings are very high)
        (and not at all offensive)
        (lock the door)
        (gonna carry on at infinite leght, my dear)

Into the Divine lyrics, but not completed.
I'll keep trying.



Into The Divine

I think you're oh, so beautiful
I think you're so kind
And I think I will miss you
If you disappear into the divine.

And I think of an apple core
When you start thinking of God
And I know I will miss you
If you disappear into the divine.

And I think you're so beautiful
And beautiful is the black space and stars
But all I see is the...
I think you're so beautiful
And I see you're as the sun
...

And I think you're so beautiful
If there's one thing I believe at all
Is how much I will miss you
If you disappear into the divine
Is how much I will miss you
If you disappear into the divine
Is how much I will miss you
If you disappear into the divine

How much
How much
How much

Into The Divine


I think you're so beautiful
I think you're so kind
And I think I would miss you 
If you disappear into the Divine
And I think of an apple core
When you start thinking of god
And I know I would miss you
If you disappear into the Divine
I think you're so beautiful
As beautiful as the blackened space and stars
But all I see is a coreless seed
When you cry for a god who's not there
But I think you're so beautiful
And I see you as a sun
That shines out through these galaxies
Shimmering and warm
And I think you're so beautiful
And if there's one thing I believe at all
It's how much I would miss you
If you disappeared into the Divine
And I think you're so beautiful
And if there's one thing 
I believe at all
It's how much I would miss you 
If you diappeared into the Divine

        I don't care about your ways

        I don't care about your days
        of carin' and not talkin'

        it doesn't matter if your sun shines out in the evening
        Don't wait
        the moon will wait for you to come on night then talkin'

        I don't care 'bout your present pay
        and the night life you keep burnin'

        it doesn't matter what they all say, gonna mess around
        It's okay
        it doesn't matter if your off or fine gonna learn

        I don't care about your ways

"It's Hard For A Girl In A World Full Of Men"
==============================================
album _Soundsville!_
(Various Artists, 1965)

written by
Lou Reed/Terry Philips/Jerry Vance/Jimmie Sims

performed by Connie Carson
==============================================


        When I was just a highschool girl
        my mother sat me down
        And gave me ...... advice
        I thought was very .....

        The ways that men are tricky
        that try to turn your hand

        So when the captain of the football team
        tried to kiss me goodnight, no-no, on a very first date
        I looked in his ..... big blue eyes
        shook my fingers and hands and face
        And forgot what mama said

        Because it's hard for a girl
        in a world full of men
        How to suppress that very
        natural young

        It's right to mind your mother
        and be proper

        But then it's hard for a girl
        in a world full of men
        It's hard for a girl
        in a world full of men

        Then I was after college
        ..........
        But I was there .... study
        the boys I would ignored

        I cap my nose and side my books
        ........ my head

        So one night while ......
        ....
        .... asked me to ride in his big new car
        I forgot what mama said

        Because it's hard for a girl
        in a world full of men
        How to suppress that very
        natural young

        It's right to mind your mother
        and be proper

        But then it's hard for a girl
        in a world full of men
        It's hard for a girl
        in a world full of men

        So with guitar I'm now a star
        known by everyone
        I'm a dedicated artist
        who has no time for fun

        My folk songs are the only things
        that ever fill my head

        So when one of those ridiculous
        rich, handsome rock 'n' roll saint
        Beetles ......  ask me to do the doo-wop
        I grab him by a shaggy hair
        And forgot what mama said

        Because it's hard for a girl
        in a world full of men
        How to suppress that very
        natural young

        It's right to mind your mother
        and be proper

        But then it's hard for a girl
        in a world full of men
        It's hard for a girl
        in a world full of men
        Hard for a girl
        in a world full of men
        Hard for a girl
        in a world full of men
        ....

"It Was A Pleasure Then"
===================================
album _Chelsea Girl_
(Nico, 1967)

written by
Lou Reed/John Cale/Christa Paeffgen

Lou Reed: guitar
===================================


        It was a pleasure then
        Could you just be here again
        To know what there was to see
        When all the Sunday people
        Where so quiet in the dark
        Afraid to be better the next day
        La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

        It was a pleasure then
        When we could sit and stare again
        Until the stars feel through the cloudy trees onto the grass
        Stars to smile with us
        Until they too had tears in their eyes
        And tell us this long tale of how much we must not agree

        It was a pleasure then
        To see the dying days again
        And horror of the nights
        Never, never, never, never be too quiet
        To keep the secret
        Hard to hide somewhere at last
        As long as we could see
        The sky confess this crime
        Of bitter tasting hatefulness
        Above our shattered minds
        It was a pleasure, it was a pleasure
        La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
        La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

"It Wasn't Me"
=============================
album _Songs For Drella_
(Lou Reed/John Cale, 1990)

written by Lou Reed/John Cale
=============================


        It wasn't me who shamed you
        it's not fair to say that
        you wanted to work, I gave you a chance at that
        It wasn't me who hurt you
        that's more credit than I'm worth
        don't threaten me with the things you do to you

        It wasn't me who shamed you
        it wasn't me who brought you down
        you did it to yourself without any help from me
        It wasn't me who hurt you
        I showed you possibilities
        the problems you had were there before you met me

        I didn't say this had to be
        you can't blame these things on me
        It wasn't me, it wasn't me, it wasn't me
        I know she's dead, it wasn't me

        It wasn't me who changed you
        you did it to yourself
        I'm not an excuse for the hole that you dropped in
        I'm not simpleminded
        but I'm no father to you all
        death exists but you do things to yourself

        I never said give up control
        I never said stick a needle in your arm and die
        It wasn't me, it wasn't me, it wasn't me
        I know he's dead but it wasn't me

        It wasn't me who shamed you
        who covered you with mud
        you did it to yourself without any help from me
        You act as if I could've told you
        or stopped you like some god
        but people never listen and you know that that's a fact

        I never said slit your wrists and die
        I never said throw your life away
        It wasn't me, it wasn't me, it wasn't me
        you're killing yourself, you can't blame me

"Jealous Guy"
======================
unreleased live
(Lou Reed, 1990)

written by John Lennon

May 05, 1990
Liverpool, UK
(John Lennon Tribute)
======================


        I was dreaming of the past
        and my heart was beating fast
        I began to lose control
        I began to lose control

        I didn't mean to make you cry
        I'm sorry that I made you cry
        I didn't wanna hurt you
        just a jealous guy

        I was feeling insecure
        you might not love me any more
        I was shivering inside
        I was shivering inside

        I didn't mean to hurt you
        I'm sorry that I made you cry
        I didn't mean to hurt you
        I'm just a jealous guy

        I didn't mean to hurt you
        I'm sorry that I made you cry
        I didn't wanna hurt you
        just a jealous guy

        I was trying to catch your eyes
        thought that you were trying to hide
        I was swallowing my pain
        I was swallowing my pain

        I didn't mean to hurt you
        I'm sorry that I made you cry
        I didn't wanna hurt you
        I'm just a jealous guy
        watch out
        I'm just a jealous guy
        look out
        I'm just a jealous guy

This is how you have the lyrics to "_Jesus"_ 
(http://ww21.tiki.ne.jp/~wildside/tabs/jesus.html)
on your Lou Reed Guitar Archive:


        Jesus, help me find my proper  place
        Jesus, help me find my  proper place

        Help me in my  weakness
        'cause I've  falling out of  grace

        Jesus,  Jesus


The word falling should be fallen.

This is the past tense of the word  "fall".
You say, "I will fall, tomorrow."  "I am falling, now."
And, "I have fallen, yesterday."
 
So the lyric should  read:


        Jesus,  help me find my proper place
        Jesus, help me find my proper  place

        Help me in my  weakness
        'cause I've  fallen out of  grace

        Jesus,  Jesus

album _Soundsville!_

written by
Lou Reed/Terry Philips/Jerry Vance/Jimmie Sims

performed by Jeannie Larimore
==============================================


        Johnny won't surf no more
        and all I do is cry
        I see sun by the shore
        just staring at the sky

        Johnny won't surf no more
        Johnny won't surf no more
        Johnny won't surf no more

        Johnny won't surf no more
        and I'm the one to blame
        For me he went out too far
        oh, oh what a shame
        
        Johnny won't surf no more
        Johnny won't surf no more
        Johnny won't surf no more

        Ooohhh
        ooohhh
        Ooohhh
        ooohhh

        Johnny, why did you have to go out so far
        he didn't have to show up
        I knew you loved me, and Johnny
        I loved you so

        Johnny won't surf no more
        Johnny won't surf no more
        Johnny won't surf no more
        Johnny won't surf no more

She's staring at the sun
J.W.S.N.M
And I'm the one to blame
For me he went out too far, oh, oh, a shame.
J.W.S.N.M
Johnny why did you have to go out so far?
...have to show up
I knew you loved me
and Johnny I loved you so.

i've seen him by the shore

        Star of wonder, star of night
        ooohhh

        Guide us through thy perfect light



        A cold coming we had of it
        Just the worst time of the year
        For a journey and such a long journey
        The ways deep
        and the weather sharp
        The very dead of winter

        And the camels galled, sore-footed, refractory
        Lying down in the melting snow
        There were times when we regretted
        the summer palaces on slopes
        the terraces, and the silken girls
        bringing sherbet
        Then the camel men cursing and grumbling
        And running away
        and wanting their liquor and women
        And the night-fires going out
        and the lack of shelters
        And the cities, hospital
        and the towns unfriendly
        And the villages dirty and charging high prices
        a hard time we had of it
        At the end we preferred to travel all night

        Sleeping in snatches
        With the voices singing in our ears, saying
        That this was all folly

        Then at dawn
        we came down to a temperate valley
        Wet
        below the snow line, smelling of vegetation
        With a running stream and a water mill
        beating the darkness and three trees on the low sky
        And an old white horse galloped away in the meadow

        Then we came to a tavern with vine-leaves over the lintel
        Six hands at an open door dicing for pieces of silver
        and feet kicking
        the empty wineskins
        But there was no information and so we continued
        and arrived at evening, not a moment too soon
        Finding the place, it was
        you may say
        satisfactory

        All this was a long time ago, I remember
        And I would do it again
        but set down
        This set down
        This
        Were we led all that way for Birth
        or Death?
        There was a Birth, certainly
        We had evidence and no doubt
        I had seen birth
        and death
        But had thought they were
        different
        this Birth
        was Hard
        and bitter agony for us
        like Death
        our death
        We returned to our places
        these Kingdoms
        But no longer at ease here
        in the old dispensation
        With an alien people
        clutching their gods
        I should be glad of another death



        Star of wonder, star of night
        ooohhh

        Guide us through thy perfect light

"Perfect Day"

album _Transformer_

written by Lou Reed
===================


        Just a perfect day
        drink sangria in the park
        And then later when it gets dark
        we go home

        Just a perfect day
        feed animals in the zoo
        Then later a movie too
        and then home

        Oh, it's such a perfect day
        I'm glad I spent it with you
        Oh, such a perfect day
        You just keep me hanging on
        you just keep me hanging on

        Just a perfect day
        problems all left alone
        Weekenders on our own
        it's such fun

        Just a perfect day
        you made me forget myself
        I thought I was someone else
        someone good

then play like _Perfect Night Live In London_ version below.

        Just a perfect day
        you make me forget myself
        I thought I was someone else
        someone good

"Keep Away"
===================================
album _Growing Up In Public_
(Lou Reed, 1980)

written by Lou Reed/Michael Fonfara
===================================


        You keep your jealousy and your snide remarks to yourself
        you know that I'm not seeing anybody else
        You just keep your ear down to the ground
        yell your head off if you hear a sound
        And here's a whistle and a badge and a phone
        you can arrest me if I'm not at home
        And if I don't keep my word I swear
        I'll keep away

        Here's some books and a puzzle by Escher
        here's Shakespeare's "Measure For Measure"
        Here's a balloon, a rubber band and a bag
        why don't you blow them up, if you think you've been had
        Here's a castle, a paper dragon and a moat
        an earring, a toothbrush and a cloak
        And if I don't keep my word I swear
        I'll keep away

        I swear I'll keep away
        from all we've ever done
        I'll keep away the good times
        and I'll keep away the fun
        I swear I'll join the army
        or maybe the marines
        I'll start to wear designer suits
        and put away my jeans

        I swear that I'll keep away
        from all my old-time friends
        I'll throw away my records
        I'll try to make amends
        I swear I'll give up gambling
        and playing with the rent
        I'll give up food and drinking
        I'll give up a life ill-spent

        Here's a yardstick you can measure me by
        here's a coupon, maybe there's something you want to buy
        Here's a band-aid in case you cut your feet
        here's a rubber mallet you can use on your front teeth
        Here's a gun no one uses anymore
        and a bracelet made of some inexpensive ore
        And if I don't keep my word
        you won't see me anymore

        I swear I'll keep away
        from dignity and pride
        I'll keep away from abstracts
        I'll keep it all inside
        Well I'll just wrap me up in butter
        and melt me on a shelf
        I'll fry in my own juices
        I'll become somebody else

        Well I'll just swear to keep away
        from everything that's good
        I'll lie down in the gutter
        where I really should
        I swear I'll light a candle
        to every modern foe
        I swear I'll close the book on this and not see you anymore
        'cause I just got to get away

Keep Away
 
You keep your jealousy and your snide remarks to yourself
You know that I'm not seeing anyone else
You just keep your ear down to the ground
Yell your head off if you hear a sound
Here's a whistle, a badge and a phone
You can arrest me if I'm not at home
And if I don't keep my word I swear
I'll keep away

Here's some books and a puzzle by Escher
Here's Shakespeare's "Measure For Measure"
Here's a balloon, a rubber band and a bag
Why don't you blow them up if you think you've been had
Here's a castle, a paper dragon and a moat
An earring, a toothbrush and a cloak
And if I don't keep my word I swear
I'll keep away

I swear I'll keep away
>From all we've ever done
I'll keep away the good times
I'll keep away the fun
I swear I'll join the army
Or maybe the marines
I'll start to wear designer suits
And put away my jeans

I swear that I'll keep away
>From all my oldtime friends
I'll throw away my records
I'll try to make amends
I swear I'll give up gambling
And playing with the rent
I'll give up food and drinking
I'll give up a life ill-spent

Here's a yardstick you can measure me by
Here's a coupon, maybe there's something you want to buy
Here's a bandaid in case you cut your feet
Here's a rubber mallet you can use on your front teeth
Here's a gun no one uses anymore
And a bracelet made of some expensive ore

"The Kids"
===================
album _Berlin_
(Lou Reed, 1973)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        They're taking her children away
        because they said she was not a good mother
        They're taking her children away
        because she was making it with sisters and brothers
        And everyone else, all of the others
        like cheap officers who would
        stand there and flirt in front of me

        They're taking her children away
        because they said she was not a good mother
        They're taking her children away
        because of the things that they heard she had done
        The black Air Force sergeant was not the first one
        and all of the drugs she took, every one, every one

        And I am the Water Boy, the real game's not over here
        But my heart is overflowing anyway
        I'm just a tired man, no words to say
        But since she lost her daughter
        it's her eyes that fill with water
        And I am much happier this way

        They're taking her children away
        because they said she was not a good mother
        They're taking her children away
        because number one was the girlfriend from Paris
        The things that they did, huh, they didn't have to ask us
        and then the Welshman from India, who came here to stay

        They're taking her children away
        because they said she was not a good mother
        They're taking her children away
        because of the things she did in the streets
        In the alleys and bars, no she couldn't be beat
        that miserable rotten slut couldn't turn anyone away

        I am the Water Boy, the real game's not over here
        But my heart is overflowing anyway
        I'm just a tired man, no words to say
        But since she lost her daughter
        it's her eyes that fill with water
        And I am much happier this way

"The Kids"
=================================
rehearsal
(Lou Reed, 1971)

* different lyrics

1971
Richard Robinson's apartment, NYC
=================================


        They're taking her children away
        because they said she was not a good mother
        They're taking her children away
        because she made love to her sisters and brothers
        She's a bad pot smoker
        she ain't got no others
        she's making a hit
        when she don't have no brothers this way

        They're taking her children away
        she says that she was not a good sister
        Taking her children away
        they said that she had always said mister
        To the way they had gone
        and grabbed her and twist her
        there was nothing to say
        'bout the way they had missed her now

        And I am the Water Man, wet water everywhere
        You know my heart is overflowing every way
        I am the Water Man, my tears are flowing everywhere
        You know my heart is overflowing
        ever since I gauged the water
        And my heart has started flowing every day

        They're taking her children away
        they thought that she was not a good mother
        They're taking her children away
        she was a bad pot smoker hitter
        And everybody thought that they'd fucked her bit her
        for all the good times that they came bored and hit her away

        And I am the Water Man, oh, my tears are flowing everywhere
        You know my tears are overflowing every day
        I am the Water Man, my tears are flowing everywhere
        You know my heart is overflowing
        oh yes, since they took my daughter and
        But my tears are overflowing every day

        [* tape skipped: (They're taking her daughters away) ?]
        they said that she was not a good mother
        They're taking her daughters away
        she was the old bad pot smoker
        She was only what they called a joker
        she came around season all of the smokers
        Like all of the switches and all of the ..... now

        I am the Water Man, my tears are flowing everywhere
        Oh, you know my heart is overflowing this way
        I am the Water Man, my tears are flowing everywhere
        Ever since they took my daughter
        my tears have been flowing harder
        Woh, and I have been like my daughter every day

What follows is what I've managed to transcribe
from the recording of "The Kids"
(Perfect Night Live in London version)
- there are some minor differences:


"The Kids" (Perfect Night Live in London version)


They're taking her children away
Because they said she's not a good mother
They're taking her children away
Because of the things that they said she had done
Aah, the black Air Force sergeant was not the first one
And all of the drugs she took, every one, every one

They're taking her children away
Because they said she's not a good mother
They're taking her children away
'Cause, number two, the girlfriend from Paris
The things they did, ooh, they didn't have to ask us
And the Welshman, came from India to stay

Ooooh, I'm the Water Boy, the real game's not over here
Aaaah, but my heart is overflowing, each and everyday
Ooooh, I'm just a quiet man, got very little to say
But since she lost her daughters
It's her heart that fills with water
And me, I'm much happier that way, 'cause that

They're taking her children away
Because they said she's not a good mother
They're taking her children away
Because of the things she did in the streets
In the alleys and [....] she couldn't be beat
That miserable rotten slut couldn't turn anyone away

Ooooh, I'm the Water Boy, ain't got much to say
But my heart is overflowing, each and everyday
I'm just a quiet man, don't have much to say
But since she lost her daughters
It's her heart that fills with water
And me, I'm much happier that way, 'cause that


And still one phrase remains obscure!

"Kill Your Sons"
=========================
album _Sally Can't Dance_
(Lou Reed, 1974)

written by Lou Reed
=========================


        All your two-bit psychiatrists
        are giving you electric shock
        they said they'd let you live at home with mom and dad
        instead of mental hospitals
        But every time you tried to read a book
        you couldn't get to page 17
        'cause you forgot where you were
        so you couldn't even read

        Don't you know they're gonna kill your sons
        don't you know gonna kill, kill your sons
        They're gonna kill, kill your sons
        until they run-run-run-run-run-run-run, run away

        Mom informed me on the phone
        she didn't know what to do about dad
        he took an axe and broke the table
        aren't you glad you're married
        And sister, she got married on the Island
        and her husband takes the train
        he's big and he's fat
        and he doesn't even have a brain

        They're gonna kill your sons
        don't you know they're gonna kill, kill your sons
        Don't you know they're gonna kill, kill your sons
        until they run away

        Creedmore treated me very good
        but Paine Whitney was even better
        and when I flipped out on PHC
        I was so sad, I didn't even get a letter
        All of the drugs that we took
        it really was lots of fun
        but when they shoot you up with thorazine on crystal smoke
        you choke like a son of a gun

        Don't you know they're gonna kill your sons
        don't you know they're gonna kill, kill your sons
        Don't you know they're gonna kill, kill your sons
        until they run-run-run-run-run-run, run away

* different lyrics

1971
NYC
==================


        All you drunken congressmen
        who getting out the vote
        by shipping out the youngest
        to war and taxpayer votes
        And filling up your jails with youth
        who will not drink or swill
        you've broken all our hearts
        but you know you cannot break our will

        Don't you know you gotta kill our sons
        you know you gotta kill our sons
        Don't you know you gotta kill our sons
        before they reclaim the land

        Politician seethes with rage
        he cannot find the words
        to express the hate he feels to all
        all of the boys and girls
        And big businesses has different ways
        to take care of the waste
        they send our sons off overseas
        blood's what they like to taste

        Don't you know you gotta kill your sons
        don't you know you gotta kill your sons
        Don't you know you gotta kill, kill, kill our sons
        before they reclaim our land

        Saturday the news is war
        and also Sunday, too
        and silver nights and dark fog days
        is war and war to you
        The president and his friends and wine
        seem to enjoy the things they do
        and those who aren't killed are thrown in jail
        then enjoy just what they do

        You know you gotta kill your sons
        you know you gotta, ooohhh, kill your sons
        Don't you know you gotta kill your sons
        before they reclaim the land

        Things aren't black and white you know
        I heard ........... say
        while drinking down his whiskey
        and eating his cardboard steak
        It's really like and what I heard
        I heard that president say
        kill the yellow funky swiftly, do it, do it ..... hands

        You know you gotta kill your sons
        you know you gotta kill your sons
        You know you gotta kill your sons
        before they reclaim the land

here's my interpretation of what Lou's singing on the version of
"Kill your sons" found on "Live in Italy":


All you two-bit psychiatrists
Are giving you electroshock
They said they'd let you live at home with mom and dad
Instead of in a hospital
And every time you tried to read a book
You couldn't get to page seventeen
'Cause you forgot where you were
And you couldn't even read

Don't you know you're gonna
Kill your sons
Don't you know you're gonna kill,
Kill your sons
Don't you know you're gonna kill,
Kill your sons
Until they run, run, run, run, run, run
Run away

Momma called me on the phone
She don't know what to do about dad
He took an axe and he broke the table
Aren't you glad your married
And sister she called me from on the island
Her husbond takes the train
She's big and she's fat
And she doesn't even have a brain

Don't you know you're gonna kill,
Kill your sons
Oh, you're gonna kill,
Kill your sons
Don't you know you're gonna kill now,
Kill your sons
Until they run, run, run, run, run
Oh, run away

Creedmore treated me really good
And Paine Whitney was even better
And when I flipped out, babe, on PHC
I was so sad I couldn't get a letter
All of the drugs that we took
It really was a lot of fun
But when they shoot you up with thorizene on crystal smoke
Choke like a son of a gun

You're gonna
Kill your sons, sons, sons, sons
You're gonna kill, kill, kill, kill
Kill, hey kill your sons, sons, sons, sons, sons
Hey, you're gonna kill
Ooooh, kill your sons now
Until they run, run, run, run
Until they run away



Notice that Lou's singing that
his sister is big, fat and in loss of a brain
and not her husbond as in the original version.

In according to this he plays the song in A,
not G as the original version.

"King Of The New York Streets"
==================================
album _Yo Frankie_
(Dion, 1989)

written by Dion DiMucci/Bill Tuohy

Lou Reed: background vocals
==================================


        People called me the scandalizer
        world was my appetizer
        I turned gangs into fertilizer
        king of the New York streets

        I broke hearts like window panes
        for breakfast I'd eat nails and chains
        To my kingdom I'd proclaim
        king of the New York streets
        ....

        You know I floored my accelerator
        all the way to the equator
        Just a local gladiator
        .... king of the New York streets

        Well I was only sixteen years old
        so what could I have known
        In my mind these passing years
        the legend sure has grown, no

        People come from miles around
        to see my royal tenement crown
        Always up and never down
        king of the New York streets
        check it out

        Schools gave me nothing needed
        to my throne I proceeded
        Every warning went unheeded
        yeah, a king of the New York streets

        Woh, I stood tall from all this feeling
        I bumped my head on heaven's ceiling
        Shooting dice and double-dealing, ah
        king of the New York streets


        Well I was only sixteen years old
        so what could I have known
        In my mind these passing years
        the legend sure has grown

        You know each time I jumped behind the wheel
        of a pin-striped custom Oldsmobile
        The guys would bow and the girls would squeal
        king of the New York streets

        Woh, local bullies I deflated
        back street jive that I translated
        Top-Ten girls were all that I dated
        king of the New York streets
        ....

        I didn't need no bodyguard, ha
        I just ruled from my backyard
        Livin' fast, livin' hard
        king of the New York streets
        check it out, we walk in the city

        I awoke one day and I realized
        You know this attitude comes from cocaine lies

"Ladies Pay"
===========================
album _Rock And Roll Heart_
(Lou Reed, 1976)

written by Lou Reed
===========================


        All the sailors they are all home for leave
        And everybody's waiting for them to try to deceive
        The storekeepers have drawn their lace curtains bare
        And all the willowy young girls are waiting there

        Oh, but how the ladies pay
        Oh, if they only knew how the ladies pay
        Here now, how the ladies pay
        Oh, when the men they have gone away

        Nobody is standing guard upon the door
        And nobody is feeding any of the poor
        The poor sick soldier lies in bed beside his girl
        Thinking of another place on the other side of the world, ah

        How the ladies pay
        Oh-oh, oh, how the ladies pay
        When the men they have gone away
        Oh, I wish I knew how the ladies pay

        Day and night, night and day
        how the ladies pay
        Day and night, night and day
        how the ladies pay
        Day and night
        night and day
        And day and night
        day and night, night and day, ladies pay now

        Night and day, day and night
        how the ladies pay

"Lady Day"
===================
album _Berlin_
(Lou Reed, 1973)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        When she walked on down the street
        She was like a child staring at her feet

        But when she passed the bar
        and she heard the music play
        She had to go in and sing
        it had to be that way
        She had to go in and sing
        it had to be that way

        And I said no no no
        oh Lady Day
        And I said no no no
        oh Lady Day

        After the applause had died down
        And the people drifted away

        She climbed down off the bar
        and went out the door
        To the hotel
        that she called home
        It had greenish walls
        a bathroom in the hall

        And I said no no no
        oh Lady Day
        And I said no no no
        oh Lady Day
        I said no no no
        oh Lady Day
        And I said no no no
        oh Lady Day
        And I said no no no

        When she walked on down the street
        She's like a child staring at her feet

        But when she passed the bar
        and she heard the music play
        She had to go in and sing
        it had to be that way
        She had to go in and sing
        it had to be that way

        I said no no no
        oh Lady Day

        After the applause had died down
        And the people drifted away

        She climbed down off the bar
        and went out the door
        To the hotel
        that she called home
        It had greenish walls
        a bathroom in the hall

        And I said no no no
        oh Lady Day
        I said no no no

"Lady Godiva's Operation"
==============================
album _White Light/White Heat_
(The Velvet Underground, 1968)

written by Lou Reed
==============================


        Lady Godiva here dressed so demurely
        pats the heads of another curly-hair boy
        Just another toy

        Sick with silence, she weeps sincerely
        saying words that have all so clearly been said
        So long ago

        Draperies wrapped gently round her shoulder
        life has made her that much bolder now
        That she's found out how

        Dressed in silk, latin lace and envy
        pride and joy of the latest penny fair
        Pretty passing care

        Hair today now dipped in the water
        making love to every poor daughter's son
        Isn't it fun

        Now today, propping grace with envy
        Lady Godiva peers to see if anyone's there
        And hasn't a care

        Doctor is coming the nurse thinks sweetly
        turning on the machine that neatly pump air
        The body lies bare

        Shaved and hairless what once was screaming
        now lies silent and almost sleeping
        The brain must have gone away

        Strapped securely to the white table
        ether caused the body to wither and writhe
        Underneath the white light

        Doctor arrives, with knife and baggage
        sees the growth as just so much cabbage
        That must now be cut away

        Now comes the moment of great, great decision
        the doctor is making his first incision
        One goes here, one goes there

        "The ether tube's leaking" says someone who's sloppy
        patient it seems is not so well sleeping
        The screams echo up the hall

        Don't panic, someone give him pentathol instantly
        doctor removes his blade cagily so from the brain
        By my count of ten, the head won't move

        Lady Godiva's Operation
        ===============
        Lady Godiva here dressed so demurely
        pats the heads of another curly-hair boy
        Just another toy

        Sick with silence, she weeps sincerely
        saying words that have all so clearly been said
        So long ago

        life has made her that much bolder now
        That she's found out how

        pride and joy of the latest penny fair
        Pretty passing care

        Isn't it fun

        Now today, propping grace with envy
        Lady Godiva peers to see if anyone's there
        And hasn't a care

        turning on the machine that NEATLY PUMP AIR
        The body lies bare

        Shaved and hairless what once was SCREAMING
        now lies silent and ALMOST SLEEPING
        The brain must have gone away

        Strapped securely to the white table

        Underneath the white light

"Last Great American Whale"
===========================
album _New York_
(Lou Reed, 1989)

written by Lou Reed
===========================


        They say he didn't have an enemy
        his was a greatness to behold
        He was the last surviving progeny
        the last one on this side of the world

        He measured a half mile from tip to tail
        silver and black with powerful fins
        They say he could split a mountain in two
        that's how we got the Grand Canyon

        Last great American whale
        last great American whale
        Last great American whale
        last great American whale

        Some say they saw him at the Great Lakes
        some say they saw him off of Florida
        My mother said she saw him in Chinatown
        but you can't always trust your mother

        Off the Carolinas the sun shines brightly in the day
        the lighthouse glows ghostly there at night
        The chief of a local tribe had killed a racist mayor's son
        and he'd been on death row since 1958

        The mayor's kid was a rowdy pig
        spit on Indians and lots worse
        The old chief buried a hatchet in his head
        life compared to death for him seemed worse

        The tribal brothers gathered in the lighthouse to sing
        and tried to conjure up a storm or rain
        The harbor parted, the great whale sprang full up
        and caused a hugh tidal wave

        The wave crushed the jail and freed the chief
        the tribe let out a roar
        The whites were drowned, the browns and reds set free
        but sadly one thing more

        Some local yokel member of the NRA
        kept a bazooka in his living room
        And thinking he had the chief in his sight
        blew the whale's brains out with a lead harpoon

        Last great American whale
        last great American whale
        Last great American whale
        last great American whale

        Well Americans don't care for much of anything
        land and water the least
        And animal life is low on the totem pole
        with human life not worth more than infected yeast

        Americans don't care too much for beauty
        they'll shit in a river, dump battery acid in a stream
        They'll watch dead rats wash up on the beach
        and complain if they can't swim

        They say things are done for the majority
        don't believe half of what you see and none of what you hear
        It's like what my painter friend Donald said to me
        "Stick a fork in their ass and turn them over, they're done"

        Last night I said goodbye to my friend
        last night I said goodbye to my friend
        Last night I saw his face and cried
        last night I wiped the tears from my eyes

        I sat with my friend
        I kissed his cheek and held his hand
        Last night I said goodbye to my friend

        Last night I said goodbye to my friend

        Last night I said goodbye to my friend

        Always miss you and that's the truth
        we've been friends so long and I love you
        I can't believe this happened, it can't be real
        I don't know what to do or say or feel

        Last night I said goodbye to my friend

        As the mighty have fallen, all the idols fall
        you were always saying you were ten feet tall
        You know it's not for real
        I don't know what to do or say or feel

        Last night I said goodbye to my friend

I took a look at "Last Night I Said Goodbye to My Friend"
at your site and found a few mistakes.
I've listened to the recording,
and here's what I think are the correct lyrics
(with the corrected lines in bold):



  Last night I said goodbye to my friend
  last night I said goodbye to my friend
  Last night I saw his face and cried
  last night I wiped the tears from my eyes

  I said goodbye my friend
  I kissed his cheek and held his hand
  Last night I said goodbye to my friend

  Last night I said goodbye to my friend
  last night I said goodbye to my friend
  Last night I saw his face and cried
  last night I wiped the tears from my eyes

*** I sat with my friend  ***
  and I held his hand
  Last night I said goodbye to my friend

***  Always miss you, and that's the truth  ***
  we've been friends so long and I love you
***  I can't believe this happened, it can't be real  ***
  I don't know what to do or say or feel

  Last night I said goodbye to my friend

***  As the mighty have fallen, all the idols fall  ***
***  you were always saying you were ten feet tall  ***
***  You know it's not for real  ***
  I don't know what to do or say or feel

  Last night I said goodbye to my friend
  Last night I said goodbye to my friend
  Last night I said goodbye to my friend
  Last night I said goodbye to my friend


On the subject of who has written the song,
Lou states at the beginning of the recording
that "This is a song the three of us wrote",
so I guess
that means it's a Lou Reed/John Cale/Moe Tucker composition.

"The Last Shot"
========================
album _Legendary Hearts_
(Lou Reed, 1983)

written by Lou Reed
========================


        Last shot sure killed me
        pour another drink
        Let's drink to the last shot
        and the blood on the dishes in the sink
        Blood inside the coffee cup
        blood on the table top

        But when you quit, you quit, but you always wish
        that you knew it was your last shot
        When you quit, you quit, but you always wish
        that you knew it was your last shot

        I shot blood at the fly on the wall
        my heart almost stopped hardly there at all
        I broke the mirror with my fall, with my -
        - Fall-fall-fall
        fall-fall-fall

        Gimmie a double, give yourself one, too
        gimmie a short beer, and one for you, too
        And a toast to everything that doesn't move
        that doesn't move

        But when you quit, you quit, but you always wish
        that you knew it was your last shot
        When you quit, you quit, but you always wish
        that you knew it was your last shot

        Whiskey, bourbon, vodka, scotch
        I don't care what it is you've got
        I just want to know that it's my last shot
        My last shot

        I remember when I quit pretty good
        see this here's where I chipped my tooth
        Shot a vein in my neck and I coughed up a Quaalude
        On my last shot
        my last shot

        Here's a toast to all that's good and -
        - here's a toast to hate
        And here's a toast to toasting and I'm not boasting
        When I say I'm getting straight
        when I say I'm getting straight

        But when you quit, you quit, but you always wish
        that you knew it was your last shot
        When you quit, you quit, but you always wish
        that you knew it was your last shot

@SONG:  The Last Shot

Last shot sure killed me
Pour another drink
Let's drink to the last shot
And the blood on the dishes in the sink
Blood inside the coffee cup
Blood on the table top
But when you quit, you quit
But you always wish
That you knew that it was your last shot
When you quit, you quit
But you always wish
That you knew that it was your last shot

I shot blood at the fly on the wall
My heart almost stopped, hardly there at all
I broke the mirrow with my fall
With my fall fall fall
Fall fall fall
Give me a double, give yourself one two
Give me a short beer, one for you too
And a toast to everything that doesn't move
That doesn't move
But when you quit, you quit
But you always wish
That you knew that it was your last shot
When you quit, you quit
But you always wish
That you knew that it was your last shot

Whisky, bourbon, vodka, scotch
I don't care what it is you've got
I just want to know that it's my last shot
My last shot
I remember when I quit pretty good
See this here, this is where I chipped my tooth
Shot of pain in my neck and I coughed up a qualude
On my last shot
My last shot

Here's a toast to all that is good
And here's a toast to hate
Here's a toast to toasting and I'm not boasting 
When I say I'm getting straight
When I say i'm getting straight
But when you quit, you quit
But you always wish
That you knew that it was your last shot
When you quit, you quit
But you always wish
That you knew that it was your last shot

        Take away the oceans
        take away the seas
        take away the sunshine
        take away the trees

        Take away the rosebuds
        that bloom in spring
        take all the blossoms
        all I asking is one thing

        Please leave my baby
        please leave her for me

        I don't care for the oceans
        I don't care for the seas
        I can do without blue skies
        or flowering trees

        But I can't do without my baby
        so please leave her for me

        Nature has beauty, nature has its place
        but when I look into my baby's face
        I lose all sense of judgement, I lose my regard
        to think only of nature somehow seems so hard

        So take away your oceans
        take away your seas
        take away your rosebuds
        all I asking is one thing

        Please leave my baby
        please leave her for me

My personal transcription of the lyrics.



Leave Her For Me


Take away the oceans
Take away the seas
Take away the sunshine
Take away the trees
Take away the rosebuds that bloom in spring
Take all the blossoms, all I asking is one thing

Please, leave my baby
Please, leave her for me

I don't care for the oceans
I don't care for the seas
I can do without blue skies or flowering trees
But I can't do without my baby
so, please, leave her for me.

Nature has beauty
Nature has its place
but when I look into my baby's face
I lose all sense of judgement
I lose my regard, to think only of Nature
somehow seems so hard.

So take away your oceans
Take away your seas
Take away your rosebuds
all I asking is one thing,

Please, leave my baby
Leave her for me.

        Oh, the times are hard and the wages low
        leave her Johnny, leave her
        I guess it's time for us to go
        and it's time for us to leave her

        Oh, I thought I heard the old man say
        leave her Johnny, leave her
        Tomorrow you will get your pay
        and it's time for us to leave her

        Liverpool Pat with his tarpaulin hat
        leave her Johnny, leave her
        It's Yankee John the packet rat
        and it's time for us to leave her

        It's rotten beef and weevily bread
        leave her Johnny, leave her
        It's pump or drown the old man said, ah huh
        and it's time for us to leave her

        We'd be better off in a nice clean jail
        leave her Johnny, leave her
        With all night and plenty of ale
        and it's time for us to leave her

        The mate was a bucko and the old man a Turk
        leave her Johnny, leave her
        The bosun was a beggar with the middle name of work
        and it's time for us to leave her

        The cook's a drunk, he likes to booze
        leave her Johnny, leave her
        'tween him and the mate there's a little to choose
        and it's time for us to leave her

        I hate to sail on this rotten tub
        ah, leave her Johnny, leave her
        No grog allowed and rotten grub
        it's time for us to leave her

        No Liverpool bread, nor rotten cracker hash
        leave her Johnny, leave her
        No dandy funk, nor cold and sloppy hash
        and it's time for us to leave her

        The old man shouts, the pumps stand by
        leave her Johnny, leave her
        Oh, we can never suck her dry
        and it's time for, time for us to leave her

        Now I thought I hear the old man say
        leave her Johnny, leave her
        Just one more pull and then belay
        and it's time for us to leave her

        It's time for us to leave her
        It's time for us to leave her
        For the voyage is done and the winds don't blow
        and it's time for us to leave her

I saw you didn't yet have the lyrics for Leave her Johnny
from the CD
Rogue's Gallery: Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs, and Chanteys.
On this CD is a song sung by Lou Reed called Leave her Johnny.
These are the lyrics:


O the times are hard and the wages low
Leave her, Johnny, leave her
I guess it's time for us to go
And it's time for us to leave her

O I thought I heard the old man say
Leave her, Johnny, leave her
Tomorrow you will get your pay
And it's time for us to leave her

Liverpool Pat with his tarpaulin hat
Leave her, Johnny, leave her
It's Yankee John the packet rat
And it's time for us to leave her

It's rotten beef and weev'ly bread
Leave her, Johnny, leave her
It's pump or drown the old man said
Ahhh, and it's time for us to leave her

We'd be better off in a nice clean gaol,
Leave her, Johnny, leave her
With all night and plenty of ale
And it's time for us to leave her

The mate was a bucko and the old man a turk,
Leave her, Johnny, leave her
The bosun was a beggar with the middle name of work
And it's time for us to leave her

The cook's a drunk, he likes to booze
Leave her, Johnny, leave her
'tween him and the mate there's a little to choose
And it's time for us to leave her

I hate to sail on this rotten tub
Ahhh, leave her, Johnny, leave her
No grog allowed and rotten grub
It's time for us to leave her

No Liverpool bread, nor rotten crackerhash,
Leave her, Johnny, leave her
No dandy funk, nor cold and sloppy hash.
And it's time for us to leave her

The old man shouts, the pumps stand by
Leave her, Johnny, leave her
Oh, we can never suck her dry
And it's time for, time for us to leave her

Now I thought I heard the old man say,
Leave her, Johnny, leave her
Just one more pull and then belay.
And it's time for us to leave her

It's time for us to leave her
It's time for us to leave her
For the voyage is done and the winds don't blow
And it's time for us to leave her

        And then there's other types, they always make you wait
        And they're the ones who always are the first to say
        "Mistake", uh

        Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone
        Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone
        Leave me, love me, love me, love me, love me forever
        Love me, love me, love me, love me, love me forever

"Leave Me Alone"
(box-set: _Between Thought And Expression_)


All the kinds of people tryin' to tell you what to do, now
But they just got to (scan ?)

Rip off cities ....... comin' from
And naked, naked soul your music isn't much fun now

Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone
Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone

Laurine? had a face she could never replace
And after the operation she lost her taste
The last time that I saw her was by C.C.N.Y.
She was going without you and she knew why

Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone
Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone, no, huh
hey, leave me alone, men

I was there to get your ... out of town
Send you to the school where the WASP don't frown
I don't think that I liked all of the things that you do
I don't wanna get at the pal I know that you're through

I say now, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me
leave me alone, no
Hey, baby, baby, baby, baby, leave me alone, get down, now
Hey, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely boy
Hey, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely boy, and now

it took a while,
but it is a starting point for the lyrics of this album.
(Take No Prisoners)


====


"Leave Me Alone"


Everybody's gonna try to tell you what to do, ha
And never, never, never, never, let it be said that it's true
Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone
Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone

Don't you know some people, they just don't know when to stop
They can't tell the floor from the ceiling or the top
Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone
Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone

Ah-ha-ha, oh, oh, yeah
Ah-ha-ha, oh, oh, yeah
Ah-ha-ha, oh, oh, yeah
Ah-ha-ha, oh, oh, yeah

Don't you know some people, they just don't know when to stop
They can't tell the floor from the ceiling or the top
Love me, love me, love me, love me, love me forever
Love me, love me, love me, love me, love me forever
Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone
Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone
Leave me alone

Ah-ha-ha, oh, oh, yeah
Ah-ha-ha, oh, oh, yeah
Ah-ha-ha, oh, oh, yeah
Ah-ha-ha, oh, oh, yeah

And there're other types, they always make you wait
And they're always the first to say, the state you come from
Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone
Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone

Leave me alone

"Legendary Hearts"
========================
album _Legendary Hearts_
(Lou Reed, 1983)

written by Lou Reed
========================


        Legendary hearts
        tearing up apart
        with stories of their love
        their great transcendent loves
        While we stand here and fight
        and lose another night
        of legendary love

        Legendary loves
        haunt me in my sleep
        promises to keep
        I never should have made
        I can't live up to this
        I'm good for just a kiss
        not legendary love

        Romeo, oh, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo
        he's in a car or at a bar
        or churning his blood with an impure drug
        He's in the past and seemingly lost forever

        He worked hard at being good
        but his basic soul was stained not pure
        and when he took his bow
        no audience was clapping

        Legendary hearts
        tear us all apart
        make our emotions bleed
        crying out in need
        No legendary love
        is coming from above
        it's in this room right now

        And you've got to fight
        to make what's right
        you've got to fight
        to make what's right
        You've got to fight
        to make what's right
        you've got to fight to keep your legendary love

"Letters To The Vatican"
==================================
album _Nothing But The Truth_
(Ruben Blades, 1988)

written by Lou Reed/Ruben Blades

Lou Reed:
co-arrangement, co-produce, guitar

(Mike Rathke: guitar)
==================================


        Rosie sits inside a bar
        smoking a large man's cigar
        In a place called "Sammy's"
        on Amsterdam Avenue

        She doesn't look a day over 65
        although she's really 29
        She likes records from the '60s
        they remind her of the good old times

        And after some wine and scotch
        Rosie starts to let it hang out
        She throws a glass at the mirror
        and asks "Big Max" for a pen

        She writes a letter to the Vatican
        I'm gonna write a letter to Him
        Dear Pope, send me some soap
        and a bottle of Bombay Gin
        A letter to the Vatican
        I'm gonna write a letter to Him
        Dear Pope, send me some hope
        or a rope to do me in

        And no one stops her
        we all lend a hand
        We all knew her
        before she got this mad
        We just hold her
        until the shaking stops

        Because the heart says
        what only the heart knows
        Because the heart says
        what only the heart knows

        I wanna hear some Dianna Ross
        I wanna hear a little bit of Marvin Gaye
        I wanna hear a song
        that reminds me of a better day

        Rosie slips and tries to stand up
        she slaps a pretty girl in the mouth
        And running to the jukebox
        she tries to put a quarter in

        She says, "I've had enough of you men
        and I'll never say yes again
        It's His Holiness or nothing
        for me in this life"

        So she writes a letter to the Vatican
        I'm gonna write a letter to Him
        Dear Pope, send me some soap
        and a bottle of Bombay Gin
        A letter to the Vatican
        I'm gonna write a letter to Him
        Dear Pope, send me some hope
        or a rope to do me in

        And no one stops her
        we all lend a hand
        See, we all knew her
        before she got this mad
        We just hold her
        until the shaking stops

        Because the heart says
        what only the heart knows
        Because the heart says
        what only the heart knows
        Because the heart says
        what only the heart knows
        Because the heart says
        what only the heart knows
        Because the heart says
        what only the heart knows
        Because the heart says
        what only the heart knows

Letters to the Vatican (L.Reed-R.Blades); );
   guitar: lou reed, mike rathke;
   arranged and produced by L. Reed-R.Blades.


lyrics:

Rosie sits inside a bar,
smoking a large man's cigar
in a place called "Sammy's", on Amsterdam Avenue.
She doesn't look a day over 65,
although she's really 29;
She likes records from the 60's,
they remind her of the good old times.
and after some wine and some scotch
Rosie starts to let it hang out.
she throws a glass at the mirror and asks: "Big Max" for a pen.
She writes a letter to the Vatican;
"I'm gonna write a letter to Him.
Dear Pope, send me some soap and a bottle of Bombay Gin.
A letter to the Vatican, i'm gonna write a letter to Him.
Dear Pope, send me some hope or a rope to do me in.
And no one stops her, we all lend a hand.
we all knew her before she got this mad.
we just hold her, until the shaking stops,
because her heart says what only her heart knows.

I wanna hear some Dianna Ross,
I wanna hear a little bit of Marvin Gaye.
I wanna hear a song that reminds me of a better day
Rosie slips and tries to stand up,
she slaps a pretty girl in the mouth and,
running to the jukebox she tries to put a quarter in.
I've had enough of you men and i'll never say yes again.
It's his Holiness or nothing for me in this life.
so She writes a letter to the Vatican;
 "I'm gonna write a letter to Him.
Dear Pope, send me some soap and a bottle of Bombay Gin.
A letter to the Vatican, i'm gonna write a letter to Him.
Dear Pope, send me some hope or a rope to do me in.
And no one stops her, we all lend a hand.
we all knew her before she got this mad.
we just hold her, until the shaking stops,
because her heart says what only her heart knows.
because the heart says what only her heart knows.

"Life"
================================
album _Damaged Goods_
(Nils Lofgren, 1995)

written by Nils Lofgren/Lou Reed
================================


        Life's the only mother I know
        gypsy death and fortune are it's motto
        Chance and maturation are the father of gestation
        the whole point of life's I think to grow
        The whole point of life's I think to grow

        Life's the only father I know
        wars recessions depressions I know
        Savage tastes of Hitler and good wines are tasting bitter
        but the only point of life's I think to grow
        Basically you're the only one I know

        Scaled down buildings burning memories that make you
        sit up sick
        Focused tunnel vision only seems to make you sweat
        heck, baby your the only one I know

        Little kids are playin' stickball in the street
        memories that make you sit up sick
        Sitting thinking trying to make things neat and complete
        ah, doesn't work I know

        Jed's in Santa Barbara I know
        Sally's in Chicago with the band
        Richard's in L.A. and I'm feeling well
        and I guess I don't know anything at all
        Baby your the only one I know

        Life's the only mother I know
        Life's the only father I know
        Life's the only mother I know

        Life's the only mother I know

So I thought I'll send it.

"Like A Possum"
===================
album _Ecstasy_
(Lou Reed, 2000)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        Good morning, it's possum day
        feel like a possum in every way
        like a possum

        Possum whiskers, possum face
        possum breath and a possum taste
        ooohhh, like a possum

        Possum tales, possum eyes
        possum bones, possum thighs
        oh, like a possum

        Possum shots, possum runs
        possum sleeps to possum drums
        calm as an angel

        Good morning, it's possum day
        I feel like a possum in every way
        like a possum

        Wake up with a possum smile
        look at me, look at this smile
        like a possum

        Things are all right, don't worry about this
        my mind's amiss, I've lost the kiss

        My smile is leaden, my gait is rubber
        and I say as one possum to another like a possum
        calm as an angel

        The only thing I hope to never see
        is another possum in this tree
        playing possum

        Just like a possum

        I got a hole in my heart the size of a truck
        it won't be filled by a one-night fuck

        Slurping and squeezing ain't it just my luck
        got a hole in my heart the size of a truck
        the size of a truck

        The devil tried to fill me up but my down was high
        as the sky is up, ah
        ain't that just my luck
        calm as an angel

        Smoking crack with a downtown flirt
        shooting and coming 'til it hurts
        calm, calm, ah, calm
        calm as an angel

        They're mating like apes in the zoo
        ah, one for me and one for you
        wouldn't it just be lovely

        Another useless night in bed, ah, ah
        by the Hudson River, the roller-bladers giving head
        used condoms float on the river edge's head

        Wouldn't it be lovely
        wouldn't it be lovely

        I got a hole in my heart the size of a truck
        it won't be filled by one-night fuck
        like a possum
        like a possum

        Ah
        calm as an angel

        You know me I like to dance a lot
        with different selves who cancel out
        one another
        I'm the only one left standing

        One likes muscles, oil and dirt
        and the other likes the women with the butt that hurts
        like a possum

        Devil tried to fill me up
        but my down was high as the sky is up
        calm as an angel

        I got a hole in my heart the size of a truck
        and it won't be filled by a one-night fuck
        like a possum

        You know me I like to drink a lot
        and carry on
        don't know which self will show up, ah
        over the 5 a.m. sun, -

        - The moon is shining
        over the docks shining
        ooohhh, calm as an angel

        Girls in the market know what I'm about
        they pinch their nipples and they lift their skirts, ah
        with a pierced tongue licking below a stained T-shirt

        Look at this smile

        My mind's amiss

        Smoking crack with a downtown flirt
        shooting and coming 'til it hurts
        calm, calm

        Sitting on a curb I throw a rock
        at the passing meat market trucks
        it's just my luck
        I'm the only one left standing

        Now you know me I like to drink a lot, ah
        only one left standing

        The girls in the market know what I'm about
        they pinch their nipples and they lift their skirts
        licking below a stained T-shirt
        calm as an angel

        Smoking crack with a downtown flirt
        shooting and coming baby 'til it hurts
        wouldn't it be, wouldn't it be

        Wouldn't it be love
        wouldn't it be lovely
        calm as an angel

        Got a hole in my heart the size of a truck
        it won't be filled by one-night fuck

        Ain't it just my luck
        I got a hole in my heart the size of a truck

        Another useless night in bed
        walk down the Hudson River getting head
        calm, calm, calm, calm, calm as an angel

        Don't know why baby, I'm still here strong
        and fearless in the outside air
        I'm the only one left standing

        I'm the only one
        the only one
        the only one left standing

        I'm the only one
        I'm the only one
        left standing
        calm as an angel

        I'm the only one
        I'm the only one, the only one
        left standing
        calm as an angel

        Shooting an coming 'til it hurts
        o'holy morning

        Calm as an angel

Like a possum
---------------
Good morning it's Possum Day
Feel like a possum in every way
like a possum
Possum whiskers, possum face

Possum breath and a possum taste
Oohh, like a possum

Possum tales, possum eyes
Possum bones, possum thighs
Oohh, like a possum
Possum shots, possum runs
Possum sleeps to possum drums
Calm as an angel

Good morning it's Possum Day
I feel like a possum in every way
Like a possum
Wake up with a possum smile
Look at me!
Look at this smile
Like a possum

Things are all right don't worry about this
My mind's amiss I've lost the kiss
My smile is leaden, my gait is rubber
And I say as one possum to another
Like a possum
Calm as an angel
The only thing I hope to never see
Is another possum in this tree
Playing possum
Just like a possum

I got a hole in my heart the size of a truck
It won't be filled by a one night fuck
Slurping and squeezing ain't it just my luck
Got a hole in my heart the size of a truck
The size of a truck

The devil tried to fill me up but my down was high
As the sky is up
Aahh, ain't that just my luck
Calm as an angel
Smoking crack with a downtown flirt
Shooting and coming 'til it hurts
Calm, calm, calm as an angel

They're mating like apes in the zoo
One for me and one for you
Wouldn't it just be lovely

Another useless night in bed
Ah, ah, by the Hudson River
The rollerbladers giving head
Used condoms float on the river edge's head
Wouldn't it be lovely
Wouldn't it be lovely
I got a hole in my heart the size of a truck
It won't be filled by one night fuck
Like a possum
Like a possum
Ooohhh, calm as an angel

You know me I like to dance a lot
With different selves who cancel out one another
I'm the only one left standing
One likes muscles, oil, and dirt
And the other likes the women with the butt that hurts
Like a possum

The devil tried to fill me up
But my down was high as the sky is up
Calm as an angel
I got a hole in my heart the size of a truck
And it won't be filled by a one night fuck
Like a Possum

You know me I like to drink a lot
And carry on
don't know which self will show up
Over the 5 A.M. sun, the moon is shining
Over the docks shining
Oo, calm as an angel

The girls in the market know what I'm about
They pinch their nipples and they lift their skirts
With a pierced tongue licking below a stained tee shirt

Look at this smile

My mind's amiss

Smoking crack with a downtown flirt
Shooting and coming 'til it hurts
Calm, calm

Sitting on a curb I throw a rock
At the passing meat market trucks
It's just my luck
I'm the only one left standing

And you know me I like to drink a lot
The only one left standing
The girls in the market know what I'm about
They pinch their nipples and they lift their skirts
Licking below a stained tee shirt
Calm as an angel
Smoking crack with a downtown flirt
Shooting and coming baby 'til it hurts
Wouldn't it be
Wouldn't it be
Wouldn't it be love
Wouldn't it be lovely
Calm as an angel

Got a hole in my heart the size of a truck
It won't be filled by one night fuck
Ain't it just my luck
Got a hole in my heart the size of a truck

Another useless night in bed
Walk down to the Hudson River getting head
Calm calm calm calm calm as an angel
Don't know why baby I'm still here
Strong and fearless in the outside air
I'm the only one left standing
I'm the only one, the only one
The only one left standing

I'm the only one
I'm the only one left standing
Calm as an angel
I'm the only one
I'm the only one
The only one left standing
Calm as an angel

Shooting an coming 'til it hurts
O, holy morning

Calm as an angel

"Lisa Says"
===================
album _Lou Reed_
(Lou Reed, 1972)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        Lisa says, on a night like this
        it'd be so nice if you gave me a great big kiss
        And Lisa says, hey honey, for just one little smile
        I'll sing and play for you for the longest while

        Lisa says
        Lisa says
        Lisa says, oh no
        Lisa says

        Lisa says, honey, you must think -
        - I'm some kinda California fool
        the way you treat me just like some kind of tool
        Lisa says, hey baby, if you stick your tongue in my ear
        then the scene around here will become very clear

        Lisa says, oh no
        Lisa says, hey, don't you be a little baby
        Lisa says, oh no
        Lisa says

        Hey, if you're looking for a good time Charlie
        well that's not really what I am
        You know some good time Charlie
        always out having his fun

        But if you're looking for some good, good lovin'
        then sit yourself right over here
        You know that those good, those good times
        they just seem to pass me by, just like pie in the sky

        And Lisa says, on a night like this
        it'd be so nice if you gave me a great big kiss
        And Lisa says, hey baby, for just one little smile
        I'll sing and play for you for the longest while
        let me hear you now

        Lisa says, oh no-no
        Lisa says, hey, don't you be a little baby
        Lisa says, oh no
        Lisa says

        Why am I so shy
        Why am I so shy, geez, you know that those -
        - good-good times, they just seem to pass me by
        Why am I so shy

        First time I saw you I was talking to myself
        I says, hey you got those pretty-pretty eyes
        (such pretty eyes)

        Now that you are next to me I just get so upset
        hey Lisa, will you tell me why am I so shy

        Why am I so shy
        Why am I so shy, well you know that those -
        - good-good times, they just seem to pass me by
        Why am I so shy

        And Lisa says, on a night like this
        it'd be so nice if you gave me a great big kiss
        And Lisa says, honey, for just one little smile
        I'll sing and play for you for the longest while

        Lisa says, oh no, now
        Lisa says, hey, don't you be a little baby
        Lisa says, oh no
        Lisa says

"Lisa Says"
===============================
unreleased live
(The Velvet Underground, 1969)

performed by
Lou Reed with mass choir

* different lyrics, bridge-less

Oct 19, 1969
End of Cole Ave., Dallas, Texas
(The Afterhours Set)
===============================


        Lisa says that I'm her only one
        and that every time we go out, we would have some fun
        And Lisa said I'm the only kind of guy
        that stands around when there's no stars in the sky
        everybody

        Lisa says, oh-wow now
        Lisa says, alright now
        Lisa says
        Lisa says

        Lisa says when she sees me down by the docks
        I'll give you a dollar, a quarter
        if you can pick Jimmy's lock
        And Lisa says, every time she sees me in the bars
        10 cents and a subway token won't get you very far

        Lisa says, oh now-now
        Lisa says
        Lisa says, alright now
        Lisa says

        Lisa says when she's on 34th Street
        I can't go to the subway when I can't stand on my feet
        And Lisa says that it's very funny
        when I think that you're so blue
        and you think that what is old is green
        and you can't find 6th Avenue

        Lisa says, oh now-now-now
        Lisa says, all right now-now
        Lisa says, ooohhh
        Lisa says

        Lisa says that when I was a young man
        I used to do things and catch it, catch I can
        And Lisa said that just 'bout in the last year or so
        she couldn't tell if I had made it to grow

        Lisa says, oh now-now
        Lisa says
        Lisa says, oh now-now
        Lisa says, one more time now

        Lisa says, all right now-now
        oh, Lisa says, now-now-now-now-now-now-now

I've attached a txt file with 3 updates on the lyrics.
(at least what I hear on my CD)
They are out in the margin in " "
right before the line to be changed.



line 21: "CAUSE A GOOD TIME CHARLIE"

line 23: "YOU KNOW THAT GOOD TIMES JUST SEEM"

I think the lyric in "Lisa Says" is
"Everytime she makes it STRAIGHT" (not streak or whatever)
(that is - straight - like, not high). (I think.)

rehearsal
(Lou Reed/Nico, 1970)

written by Chuck Berry

Apr 1970
hotel room, NYC
======================


        There she's my queen standin' over by the record machine
        Lookin' like a pretty ..... the cover of some magazines
        She's too cute to be a minute over seventeen

        Meanwhile, I'm still thinkin'
        Little Queenie
        ............
        If it's a slow song, we'll omit it
        and if it's a rocker, we're goin' to get it
        Come on, Queenie



* all the strings downtuned a whole-tone
* note: this song has different pitch
(NOT "A=440Hz". about a half note down).
so total "1 + 1/2" tone down.
This tuning pitch is same as "Wildwood Flower", "Jessie James",
"The Sinking Of The Reuben James", "Little Sister (take 3 and 4)".

 1d ----- * downtuned a whole-tone (from e to d)
 2A ----- * downtuned a whole-tone (from B to A)
 3F ----- * downtuned a whole-tone (from G to F)
 4C ----- * downtuned a whole-tone (from D to C)

        You know it's hard for me
        I cannot use the phone
        and in the shade of publicity
        no relationship is born
        And I feel like a Hercules

        But you always believed in me

        Pick a melody
        then count from one to ten (eight, nine, ten)
        I'll make a rhyme up

        to a past that might have been

        Don't call me home, little sister
        Before the night is done
        My love and I are fleeing
        Running into the sun

        Turn to fly, go away
        Little bird, please don't stay
        Fare thee well

        Take up all your jewels and cold
        Bury them away in the earth
        Let your memory reduce them to dust
        But don't forget the knife that was thrust

        Turn to fly, go away
        Little bird, please don't stay
        Fare thee well

        Frozen kiss by the fountain
        Running into the sea
        Where shadows choose their horrors
        Designed for music

        Turn to fly, go away
        Little bird, please don't stay
        Fare thee well

"Long Way Back Again"
===================================
album _A Date With The Smithereens_
(The Smithereens, 1994)

written by Pat DiNizio

Lou Reed: guitar solos
===================================


        Not hurtin' anyone
        that's all she had to say
        I'm only havin' fun
        they just got in the way

        Did it much matter then
        tell me I need to know
        The things that they made me do
        the way that I had to go

        Long way back again
        oh yeah

        Listening to her right now
        not listening anyhow
        The girl's got some things to say
        not listening anyway

        Why does it have to be
        why do they need to know
        She put them down one by one
        she put on a real good show

        Long way back again

        Once she believed in love so fine
        She won't be understanding this time
        (she's just beginning to grow)
        Voices keep goin' round in my head
        (they keep on sayin' it's so)
        I still can't understand what they said
        (you know they come from below)

        Not hurtin' anyone
        that's all she had to say
        I was just havin' fun
        they just got in the way

        Did it much matter then
        tell me I need to know
        The things that they made me do
        the way that I had to go

        Long way back again

        Long way back again
        long way back again
        Long way back again
        long way back, let's go

        Long way back again
        long way back again
        Long way back again
        long way back again

"Love Can Make You Cry"
=====================================================
album _Irma Thomas - Maxine Brown - Ronnie Dickerson_
(Various Artists, 1965)

written by
Terry Philips/Jerry Vance/Jimmie Sims/Lou Reed

performed by Ronnie Dickerson
=====================================================


        It's just a way you look
        and hold my hand when I am blue
        It's although silly thing
        that you just seem to always do

        Sending flowers to celebrate day
        that we met just since you make me say

        Love can make you cry
        Love can make you cry

        It's just a way I feel
        when you are close, so close to me
        That makes me realize
        without your love, well I would be

        Setting lonely sitting home alone
        by myself moment of my own

        Love can make you cry
        Love can make you cry

        Darling, if I met you
        I have nothing, nothing at all
        I was -

        Setting lonely sitting home alone
        by myself moment of my own

        Love can make you cry
        Love can make you cry, I'm so happy
        (Love can make you cry)

album _Growing Up In Public_
(Lou Reed, 1980)

written by Lou Reed/Michael Fonfara
===================================


        Love is here, here to stay
        love is here, here to stay
        It gets proven every day
        love is here, here to stay

        They both love Chinese food, he hates to dress
        he loves to play pinball, she wants to play next
        She likes her novels long, he's into comic books
        they're gilt-edged polymorphous urban but somehow it works

        'Cause love is here, here to stay
        love is here, here to stay
        It gets proven every day
        love is here, here to stay

        She likes Truman Capote, he likes Gore Vidal
        he likes Edgar Allan Poe, she's into Mean Joe Greene
        She thinks eating meat's disgusting, he likes hot dogs
        she's into Gestalt therapy
        while est and the vest just make him ill
        But love is here to stay

        Love is here, here to stay

"Love Makes You Feel"
=====================
album _Lou Reed_
(Lou Reed, 1972)

written by Lou Reed
=====================


        Life isn't what is seems
        I'm forever drifting into dreams
        Such a sad affair
        to always be drifting into air

        But it's not what you say or you do
        that makes me feel like I am falling
        It's things that we've both been through
        that makes me feel like I am upside down

        And love makes you feel ten foot tall
        Yes, love makes you feel ten foot tall

        Just a funny thing
        I'm forever drifting into dreams
        Huh, just not the proper thing
        to always be drifting into dreams

        But it's not what you say or you do
        that makes me feel like I am falling
        It's things that we've both been through
        that makes me feel like I am upside down

        And love makes you feel ten foot tall
        Yes, love makes you feel ten foot tall

        And it sounds like this

Apr-Jul 1970
Atlantic Recording Studios, NYC
=====================================


        Things aren't what they seem
        I'm always drifting into dream
        It's just a silly scene
        everything I do ends up in dream

        But it's not what you say and you do
        that makes it look hard of what your feelin'
        It's just what you say to do
        that makes me feel like your head is real and down

        Oh, and love makes you feel, oh, ten foot tall
        Oh, and love makes you feel ten foot tall

        It's not a funny scene
        but I'm always drifting, oh, into dreams, ah
        It's not a love affair
        but I'm just drifting into air

        But it's not what you say and you do
        oh, that makes it seem like a certain party
        It's just all of that you do
        that makes me feel that you kidding, way too smart

        Oh, and, love makes you feel ten foot tall
        Oh, and love makes you feel ten foot tall
        like this

        'Cause love makes you feel ten foot tall

Here's yet another song I've tried to "freshen up" a bit.
It's the demo of Love makes you feel from Fully loaded edition...



Things aren't what they seem
I'm always drifting into dream
It's just a silly scene
Everything I do ends up in dream

But it's not what you say and do
That makes it look hard of what your feelin'
It's just what you say to do
That makes me feel like your head is real and down

Oh, and, love makes you feel, oh, ten foot tall
Oh, and love makes you feel, ten foot tall
It's not a funny scene
But I'm always drifting, oh, into dreams

It's not a love affair
But I'm just drifting into air
But it's not what you say and you do
Oh, that makes it seem like a certain party

It's just all of that you do
That makes me feel that you kidding, way too smart
Oh, and, love makes you feel, ten foot tall
Oh, and love makes you feel, ten foot tall

Like this

Cause love makes you feel, ten foot tall
Cause love makes you feel, ten foot tall

"Mad"
===================
album _Ecstasy_
(Lou Reed, 2000)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        Mad, you just make me mad
        I hate your silent breathing in the night
        Sad, you make me sad
        when I juxtapose your features I get sad

        I know I shouldn't had someone else in our bed
        but I was so tired, I was so tired
        who would think you'd find a bobby pin

        Bark, why don't you just bark
        sit, come, stay are the perfect words meant for you
        Ah, ass, you says I'm an ass
        you better call 911 just I'm gonna hold you tight

        I know I shouldn't had someone else in our bed
        but I was so tired, so tired
        you said you're out of town for the night
        and I believed in you, I believed you
        And I was so tired, it makes me so mad

They are the exact words he sings,
not just lyrics I copied from the booklet.



Mad
-----

Mad
you just make me mad
I hate your silent breathing in the night
Sad
you make me sad
when I juxtapose your features I get sad

I know I shouldn't a had someone else in our bed
but I was so tired, I was so tired
Who would think you'd find a bobby pin
It just makes me mad
makes me mad
It just makes me,
makes me mad

Glad
when I'm gone you're glad
that overwhelming tension dissipates
Oh Tad
you think I'm a baby
nobody likes to hear "why don't you grow up"
at dawn

I know I shouldn't had someone else in our bed
but I was so tired, so tired
Who would think you'd find a bobby pin
It makes me mad
it makes me mad
Don't you know it just makes me mad
It just makes me mad

Dumb
you're dumb as my thumb
In the wistful morning you throw a coffee cup at my head
Scum
you said I'm scum
What a very lovely feminine thing to do

Bark
why don't you just bark
Sit, come, stay, are the perfect words meant for you
Ass
you says I'm an ass
You better call 911 just I'm gonna hold you tight

I know I shouldn't a had someone else in our bed
but I was so tired, I was so tired
You said you're out of town for the night
and I believed in you
I believed you
and I was so tired
It makes me so mad
It makes me so mad
It makes me so mad
It just makes me mad
It makes me mad
It makes me mad
It makes me mad
It makes me mad
It makes me mad
Dumb

"Magic And Loss - The Summation"
================================
album _Magic And Loss_
(Lou Reed, 1992)

written by Lou Reed/Mike Rathke
================================


        When you pass through the fire
        you pass through humble
        you pass through a maze of self doubt
        When you pass through humble
        the lights can blind you
        some people never figure that out

        You pass through arrogance
        you pass through hurt
        you pass through an ever present past
        And it's best not to wait for luck to save you
        pass through the fire to the light

        Pass through the fire to the light
        pass through the fire to the light
        It's best not to wait for luck to save you
        pass through the fire to the light

        As you pass through the fire
        your right hand waving
        there are things you have to throw out
        That caustic dread inside your head
        will never help you out

        You have to be very strong
        'cause you'll start from zero
        over and over again
        And as the smoke clears
        there's an all consuming fire
        lying straight ahead

        Lying straight ahead
        lying straight ahead
        As the smoke clears
        there's an all consuming fire
        lying straight ahead

        They say no one person can do it all
        but you want to in your head
        But you can't be Shakespeare
        and you can't be Joyce
        so what is left instead

        You're stuck with yourself
        and a rage that can hurt you
        you have to start at the beginning again
        And just this moment
        this wonderful fire
        started up again

        When you pass through humble
        when you pass through sickly
        when you pass through I'm better than you all
        When you pass through anger
        and self deprecation
        and have the strength to acknowledge it all

        When the past makes you laugh
        and you can savor the magic
        that let you survive your own war
        You find that that fire is passion
        and there's a door up ahead not a wall

        As you pass through fire
        as you pass through fire
        try to remember its name
        When you pass through fire
        licking at your lips
        you cannot remain the same

        And if the building's burning
        move towards that door
        but don't put the flames out
        There's a bit of magic in everything
        and then some loss to even things out

        Some loss to even things out
        some loss to even things out
        There's a bit of magic in everything
        and then some loss to even things out

"Magician - Internally"
=======================
album _Magic And Loss_
(Lou Reed, 1992)

written by Lou Reed
=======================


        Magician, magician
        take me upon your wings
        and gently roll the clouds away

        I'm sorry, so sorry
        I have no incantations
        only words to help sweep me away

        I want some magic to sweep me away
        I want some magic to sweep me away
        I want to count to five
        turn around and find myself gone
        Fly me through the storm
        and wake up in the calm

        Release me from this body
        from this bulk that moves beside me
        Let me leave this body far away

        I'm sick of looking at me
        I hate this painful body
        that disease has slowly worm away

        Magician, take my spirit
        inside I'm young and vital
        Inside I'm alive, please take me away

        So many things to do, it's too early
        for my life to be ending
        For this body to simply rot away

        I want some magic to keep me alive
        I want a miracle, I don't want to die
        I'm afraid that if I go to sleep, I'll never wake
        I'll no longer exist
        I'll close my eyes and disappear
        and float into the mist

        Somebody, please hear me
        my hand can't hold a cup of coffee
        My fingers are weak, things just fall away

        Inside I'm young and pretty
        too many things unfinished
        My very breath taken away

        Doctor, you're no magician
        and I am no believer
        I need more than faith can give me now

        I want to believe in miracles
        not just belief in numbers
        I need some magic to take me away

        I want some magic to sweep me away
        I want some magic to sweep me away
        Visit on this starlit night
        replace the stars, the moon, the light, the sun's gone
        Fly me through this storm

"Make Up"
===================
album _Transformer_
(Lou Reed, 1972)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        Your face when sleeping is sublime
        And then you open up your eyes

        Then comes pancake factor number one
        eyeliner, rose hips and lip gloss, such fun
        You're a slick little girl
        you're a slick little girl

        Rouge and coloring, incense and ice
        perfume and kisses, ooohhh, it's all so nice
        You're a slick little girl
        you're such a slick little girl

        Now, we're coming out
        out of our closets
        Out on the streets
        yeah, we're coming out

        When you're in bed it's so wonderful
        it'd be so nice to fall in love
        When you get dressed I really get my fill
        people say that it's impossible

        Gowns lovely made out of lace
        and all the things that you do to your face
        You're a slick little girl
        oh, you're a slick little girl

        Eyeliner, whitener then color the eyes
        yellow and green, ooohhh, what a surprise
        You're a slick little girl
        oh, you're such a slick little girl

        Now, we're coming out
        out of our closets
        Out on the streets
        yes, we're coming out
        Yeah, we're coming out
        yeah, we're coming out

"Make Up Mind"
========================
album _Legendary Hearts_
(Lou Reed, 1983)

written by Lou Reed
========================


        I can't seem to make up my mind
        I can't tell the colors
        That will fit this room
        I can't tell a thing about you make up my mind

        I can't seem to make up my mind
        are you laughing at me
        Or telling a joke, the cigarette on the sheet
        begins to smoke, make up your mind

        Right or left, up or down
        in or out, straight or round
        Love or lust, rain or shine
        I can't seem to make up my poor mind

        I can't seem to make up my mind
        I can't tell the difference between wrong and right
        are you laughing at me in your sleep tonight

        Leaving me behind
        leaving me behind
        Why don't you make up your mind
        (I can't seem to make up my mind)
        about leaving me behind
        (I can't seem to make up my mind)

"Mama's Got A Lover"
====================
album _Mistrial_
(Lou Reed, 1986)

written by Lou Reed
====================


        Mama's got a lover
        a painter I am told
        she's getting out of real estate
        for the art scene down in old Soho
        Art scene in old Soho

        Mama's got a lover
        he owns a gallery
        she says he likes collages but
        the money's in graffiti
        Money's in graffiti

        Mama's got a lover
        I met him yesterday
        she says she hopes I like him
        maybe I'll send him a card on Father's Day
        Father's Day

        Mama's got a lover
        they're backing a film
        it's about a working mother
        who gives birth to black and white Siamese twins
        Black and white Siamese twins

        Mama's got a lover
        he's got something to say
        he says he's into dirt and rot
        The essence of "urban decay"
        "Urban decay"

        Mama's got a lover
        we met yesterday
        she says she hopes I like him
        I'll send him a card on Father's Day
        On Father's Day

        Mama's got a lover
        I met him yesterday
        she's starting a new chapter
        I wish she was on the last page
        The last page

        Mama's got a lover
        we met yesterday
        she says she hopes I like him
        I'll send him a card on Father's Day
        Father's Day

        Mama's got a lover (Mama's got a lover)
        oooohhh, mama's got a lover (Mama's got a lover)
        Oh, mama's got a lover (Mama's got a lover)
        my mama's got a lover (Mama's got a lover)
        (Mama's got a lover)

"Mama's Got A Lover"

Mama's Got a Lover
A painter I am told
She's getting out of real estate
For the art scene down in old Soho

Mama's Got a Lover
He owns a gallery
She says he likes collages but
The money's in graffiti

Mama's Got a Lover
I met him yesterday
She says she hopes I like him
maybe I'll send him a card on Father's Day

Mama's Got a Lover
They're backing a film
It's about a working mother
Who gives birth to black and white
Siamese twins

Mam's Got a Lover
he's got something to say
He says he's into dirt and rot
The essence of "urban decay"

Mama's Got a Lover
We met yesterday
She says she hopes I like him
I'll send him a card on Father's Day

Mama's Got a Lover
I met him yesterday
She's starting a new chapter
I wish she was on the last page

"Martial Law
========================
album _Legendary Hearts_
(Lou Reed, 1983)

written by Lou Reed
========================


        I've declared a truce, so stop your fighting
        the marshall is in town
        I won't put up with no bigmouth yapping
        at least not while I'm around
        This here is my friend Ace, he's from the 8th precinct
        nothing goes on that he don't know
        And we've been send 'cause your arguments
        have been going on too long
        And before one of you hurts the other one of you
        I'm declaring martial law

        I came, I saw, I declared martial law
        I'm the marshall in this city
        The jails are filled with people like you
        you oughta listen to your diddy-wah-diddy
        What's a girl like you doing with that lamp
        you better drop that down on the floor
        And son, that isn't very smart
        kicking a hole in that door
        Hey Ace, will you take a look at this place
        and get those neighbors out of the hall
        I'm declaring martial law

        I came, I saw, I declared martial law
        'cause I'm the marshall in this city
        And if you stand away, I've got something to say
        that might even help you
        Keep your hands to yourself and keep your bigmouth shut
        don't you touch nobody with hate-hate-hate-hate
        And if all you've got is poison in your mouth
        make sure that you don't speak
        It's 3:30 in the early morning
        don't punch, don't scratch, don't bite
        Try not to take the garbage of the day
        to anyplace else but outside

        Now me and Mr. Ace are gonna leave this place
        and this fighting's gonna end
        And if we're called back, I'm gonna knock you flat
        and stack you end to end

        Ah, I came, I saw, I declared martial law
        I'm the marshall in this city
        I came, I saw, I declared martial law
        I'm the marshall in this city, ooohhh
        I came, I saw, I declared martial law
        'cause I'm the marshall in this city
        I came, I saw, I declared martial law
        'cause I'm the marshall in this city

        Now this here's my friend Ace, he's from the 8th precinct
        nothing goes on he don't know
        And I've been called 'cause your arguments
        been going, baby, on too long
        And before one of you, oh, hurts the other one of you
        Baby, I'm declaring martial law

        I came, I saw, I declared martial law
        'cause I'm the marshall in this city
        And the jails are filled with people like you
        you better listen to your diddy-wah-diddy
        What's a girl like you doin' with that lamp

        And son, that isn't very smart
        kickin' a hole in that door
        Hey Ace, will you get I'm out of this place

album _Wild Angel_
(Nelson Slater, 1976)

Lou Reed:
produce, piano, guitar, background vocals
=========================================


        Now that I remember who you are
        I have to come to you
        Now I see I never can go too far
        to find someone like you

        And I'll be ready when
        you pass my way again
        And I've heard about you on the wind
        and oh, what a spark of life you've been

        My memory girl, you've made me aware
        my memory girl, you've always been there
        Memory girl, so welcome and sweet
        memory girl, you're so good to me
        Memory girl, I wish that I could see

        My memory girl

        In the deepest part of what I am
        and what you mean to me
        There has always been a hidden plan
        that was unseen to me

        And now I see you are
        right where you'll always be
        And like a guiding star
        you keep reminding me

        My memory girl, you've made me aware
        my memory girl, you've always been there
        Memory girl, so welcome and clear
        memory girl, you've always been there
        Memory girl, I wish that you are here

        My memory girl

        My memory girl, you've made me aware
        memory girl, you've always been there
        Memory girl, so welcome and sweet
        memory girl, you're so good to me
        Memory girl, I wish that I could see

        My memory girl
        oh, I wish that I could see you now
        Everyday, I remember
        oh, everyday .... I cound see you now

"Men Of Good Fortune"
=====================
album _Berlin_
(Lou Reed, 1973)

written by Lou Reed
=====================


        Men of good fortune
        often cause empires to fall
        While men of poor beginnings
        often can't do anything at all

        The rich son waits for his father to die
        the poor just drink and cry
        And me, I just don't care at all

        Men of good fortune
        very often can't do a thing
        While men of poor beginnings
        often can do anything

        At heart they try to act like a man
        handle things the best way they can
        They have no rich daddy to fall back on

        Men of good fortune
        often cause empires to fall
        While men of poor beginnings
        often can't do anything at all

        It takes money to make money they say
        look at the Fords, but didn't they start that way
        Anyway, it makes no difference to me

        Men of good fortune
        often wish that they could die
        While men of poor beginnings
        want what they have and to get it they'll die

        All those great things that life has to give
        they wanna have money and live
        But me, I just don't care at all

        Men of good fortune
        men of poor beginnings
        Men of good fortune
        men of poor beginnings
        Men of good fortune

"Men Of Good Fortune"
===========================================
album _Berlin: Live At St. Ann's Warehouse_
(Lou Reed, 2008)

Dec 15 (or 16), 2006
St. Ann's Warehouse, Brooklyn, NY
===========================================


        Men of good fortune
        often cause empires to fall
        While men of poor beginnings
        often can't do anything at all

        The rich son waits for his father to die
        the poor just drink and cry
        And me, I just don't care at all

        Men of good fortune
        very often can't do a thing
        While men of poor beginnings
        often can do anything

        At heart they try to act like a man
        handle the things best way they can
        They got no rich daddy to fall back on

        Men of good fortune
        men of poor beginnings
        Men of good fortune
        men of poor beginnings

        Men of good fortune
        often cause empires to fall
        While men of poor beginnings
        often can't do anything at all

        It takes money to make money they say
        look at Fords, didn't they start that way
        Anyway, makes no difference to me

        Men of good fortune
        (men of poor beginnings)
        (Men of good fortune)
        men of poor beginnings

        Men of good fortune
        mmmm.., often wish that they could die
        While men of poor beginnings
        want what they have, to get it they'll die

        All those great things that life has to give
        they wanna have money and live
        But me, I don't care at all

        Men of good fortune
        men of poor beginnings

"Mistrial"
===================
album _Mistrial_
(Lou Reed, 1986)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        When I was six, I had my first lady
        when I was eight, my first drink
        When I was fourteen, I was speeding in the streets
        what could anybody say to me

        You can call me Mister, you can call me Sir
        but don't you point your finger at me

        I want a mistrial to clear my name
        I want a mistrial in front of the people
        I want a mistrial to clear my name
        I want to bring my case to the people of New York City

        When I was thirty, my attitude was bad
        if I said differently it'd be a lie
        But there's some smarts you learn down in the street
        that a college education can't buy

        You can call me Mister, or you can call me Sir
        but don't you point your finger at me, oh

        I want a mistrial to clear my name
        I want a mistrial in front of the people
        I want a mistrial to clear my name
        I want to bring my case to
        in front of the people at New York City

        You can call me Mister, or you can call me Sir
        but don't you point your finger at me, hey

        I want a mistrial to clear my name
        I want a mistrial in front of the people, I, I -
        I want a mistrial to clear my name
        I want to bring my case to the people at New York City

        And I said, M, I, S-T-R-I-A-L, mistrial
        in front of all the people
        I said, M, I, S-T-R-I-A-L, mistrial
        in front of the people of New York City

        Mistrial
        .... the people of New York City
        I said mistrial
        M-I-S-T-R-I-A-L ....

"Mistrial"

When I was six I had my first lady
When I was eight my first drink
When I was fourteen I was speeding
        in the street
What could anybody say to me
You can call me Mister
You can call me Sir
But don't you point your finger at me

I want a Mistrial
To clear my name
I want a Mistrial in front of the people
I want a Mistrial
To clear my name
I want to bring my case to the people
        of New York City

When I was thirty my attitude was bad
If I said differently it'd be a lie
But there's some smarts you learn down
        in the street
That a college education can't buy
You can call me Mister
Or you can call me Sir
But don't you point your finger at me

I want a Mistrial
To clear my name
I want a Mistrial in front of the people
I want a Mistrial
To clear my name
I want to bring my case to the people
        at New York City

And I said M-I-S-T-R-I-A-L----Mistrial
In front of all the people
I said M-I-S-T-R-I-A-L----Mistrial
In front of the people of New York City

"Modern Dance"
===================
album _Ecstasy_
(Lou Reed, 2000)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        Maybe I should go and live in Amsterdam
        in a side street near a big canal
        spend my evenings in the van Gogh Museum
        what a dream van Gogh Museum

        Or maybe it's time to see Tangiers
        a different lifestyle, some different fears
        and maybe I should be in Edinburgh
        in a kilt in Edinburgh

        Doin' a modern dance
        doin' a modern dance

        Or maybe I should get a farm in southern France
        where the winds are wispy and the villagers dance
        and you and I we'd sleep beneath a moon
        moon in June and sleep till noon

        And maybe you and I could fall in love
        regain the spirit that we once had
        you'd let me hold you and touch the night
        that shines so bright, so bright with fright

        Doin' a modern dance
        doin' a modern dance

        Shit, maybe I could go to Yucatan
        where women are women, a man's a man
        ah, no one confused, ever loses place
        with their place in the human race

        Maybe I'm not cut out for city life
        the smell of exhaust, the smell of strife
        and maybe you don't wanna be a wife
        it's not a life being a wife

        Doin' a modern dance
        doin' a modern dance

        So maybe I should go to Tanganyika
        where the rivers run, down mountains tall and steep
        or go to India to study chants
        and lose romance to a mantra's dance

        I need a guru, I need some law
        explain to me the things we saw
        and why it always comes to this
        it's all downhill after the first kiss

        Maybe I should move to Rotterdam
        maybe move to Amsterdam
        I should move to Ireland, Italy, Spain
        Afghanistan where there is no rain

        Or maybe I should just learn a modern dance
        where roles are shifting the modern dance
        you never touch you don't know who you're with
        this week, this month, this time of year
        this week, this month, this time of year

        Doin' a modern dance
        you don't know who you're with modern dance
        I should move to Pakistan, go to Afghanistan
        Dance, you don't know who you're with
        dance, you don't know who you're with
        modern dance
        And maybe you don't want to be a wife
        it's not a life being a wife
        doin' a modern dance
        you never touch you don't know who you're with
        Dance, modern dance
        the roles are shifting dance
        you never touch you don't know who you're with
        Dance, modern dance
        maybe you don't want to be a wife
        it's not a life being a wife

They are the exact words he sings,
not just lyrics I copied from the booklet.



Modern dance
---------------
Maybe I should go and live in Amsterdam
in a side street near a big canal
Spend my evenings in the Van Gogh museum
What a dream Van Gogh museum

Or maybe its time to see Tangiers
A different lifestyle, some different fears
and maybe, I should be in Edinburgh
In a kilt in Edinburgh

Doin' a modern dance
Doin' a modern dance

Or maybe I should get a farm in southern France
where the winds are wispy
and the villagers dance
And you and I, we'd would sleep beneath a moon
Moon in June and sleep till noon
And maybe you and I could fall in love
Regain the spirit that we once had
You'd let me hold you and touch the night
that shines so bright
So bright with fright

Doin' a modern dance
Doin' a modern dance

Shit, maybe I could go to Yucatan
where women are women, a man's a man
No one confused
ever loses place
with their place
in the human race

Maybe I'm not cut out for city life
The smell of exhaust, the smell of strife
And maybe you don't want to be a wife
it's not a life being a wife

Doin'a modern dance
Doin'a modern dance

So maybe I should go to Tanganyika
Where the rivers run
down mountains tall and steep
Or go to India to study chants
and lose romance to a mantra's dance
I need a guru I need some law
Explain to me the things we saw
and why it always comes to this
It's all downhill after the first kiss

Maybe, I should move to rotterdam
Maybe move to Amsterdam
I should move to Ireland
Italy, Spain, Afghanistan
where there is no rain
Or maybe I should just learn a modern dance
Where roles are shifting the modern dance
You never touch you don't know who you're with
this week, this month, this time of year
This week, this month, this time of year

Doin' a modern dance

You don't know who you're with
Modern dance
I should move to Pakistan go to Afghanistan
Dance
You don't know who you're with
Dance
You don't know who you're with
Modern dance
And maybe you don't want to be a wife
it's not life being a wife
Doin' a modern dance
You never touch, you don't know who you're with
Dance
Modern dance
The roles are shifting
Dance
You never touch, you don't know who you're with
Dance
Modern dance
Maybe you don't want to be a wife
it's not life being a wife

"Mongo And Longo"
==============================================
from the play _Time Rocker_
(Robert Wilson/Darryl Pinckney/Lou Reed, 1996)

written by Lou Reed

performed by actors, German musicians

Jun 11, 1996
Thalia Theater, Hamburg, Germany
(pre-premiere)
==============================================


        When daddy died he made me a slave
        yes, when my daddy died he left me everything
        The tent, the circus, the cook, this chair
        everything you see and smell including the air
        And I, Mr. Mongo, get to forever serve you
        and I, Mr. Longo, am glad that you do

        Things have always been this way
        one's the master, one's the slave
        Things have always been this way
        one's the master, one's the slave

        Mr. Mongo bring me bread
        the wine of insects with an eight year head
        Some cockroach 30 with a fragrant musk
        and serve it in daddy's head by the bust
        How nice it is to be this way
        he's the master, he's the slave

        Things have always been this way
        one is master, one is slave



        [dialogue in German]



        I was left nothing so I have to behave
        and the fact is I'm happier being a slave
        For I always do good and I don't have to think
        I'm happier that way I think
        There's too much stress and responsibility
        being the one who is always free
        If I had a choice I would still remain me
        some are meant to serve

        it's been this way since the beginning of time
        Let's drink a toast with some old dead bug wine
        it's been this way since the beginning of time

        [dialogue in German]



        I was made for power, it seems obvious now
        as beloved dead pater was aware all along
        Some are born to greatness, some are born to crawl
        you know that it's true, he can't make his mind up at all
        There's no question in my mind that it's better that way
        I am the master, he's the slave

"Mr. Blackwell"
============================
album _Music From The Elder_
(Kiss, 1981)

written by
Gene Simmons/Lewis Reed
============================


        I never said I was more than I am
        Do what I want, I don't give a damn
        You're all so weak you know it makes me ill
        Don't like you now and probably never will

        You cheat and lie and wonder why
        you can't sleep at night

        You're not well, oh Mr. Blackwell
        and we can tell
        You're not well, oh Mr. Blackwell
        why don't you go to hell

        I am a sinner who just loves to sin
        I am a fighter who just loves to win
        I am the truth about this crummy hole
        There's nothing here that can't be bought or sold

        You're cold and mean and in between
        you're rotten to the core

        You're not well, oh Mr. Blackwell
        and we can tell
        You're not well, oh Mr. Blackwell
        why don't you go to hell

        You're a victim, a real disgrace
        you should be banished from the human race

        We'll drink to sorrow then we'll drink to waste
        We'll drink a toast to the inhuman race
        Here's to the world and the times we're in
        Here's to the kid a real man among men

        You're cold and mean and in between
        you're rotten to the core

        You're not well, oh Mr. Blackwell
        and we can tell
        You're not well, oh Mr. Blackwell
        why don't you go to hell

"The Murder Mystery"
==============================
album _The Velvet Underground_
(The Velvet Underground, 1969)

written by Lou Reed
==============================


        [right channel]

Lou:    Denigrate obtuse and active verbs pronouns
        skewer the sieve of the optical sewer
        Release the handle that holds all the gates up
        puncture the eyeball that seeps all the muck up
        Read all the books and the people worth reading
        and still see the muck on the sky of the ceiling

Doug:   Mister Moonlight
        succulent smooth and gorgeous
        Isn't it nice
        we're number one and so forth
        Isn't it sweet
        being unique

Lou:    Relent and obverse and inverse and perverse
        and reverse the inverse of perverse and reverse
        And reverse and reverse and reverse and chop it
        and pluck it and cut it and spit it and sew it
        To joy on the edge of a cyclop and spinet
        to rage on the edge of a cylindrical minute

Doug:   Dear Mister Muse
        fellow of wit and gentry
        Medieval ruse
        filling the shallow and empty
        Fools that dual
        dual in pools

Lou:    Tantalize poets with visions of grandeur
        as their faces turn blue with the reek of the compost
        As the living try hard to retain what the dead lost
        with the double dead sickness from writing at what cost
        And business and business and reverse and reverse
        and set the brain reeling the inverse and inverse

Doug:   English arcane
        tantamount here to frenzy
        Passing for me
        lascivious elder passion
        Corpulent filth
        disguised as silk

Lou:    With cheap simian melodies hillbilly outgush
        for illiterate ramblings, for cheap understanding
        For mass understanding the simple the inverse
        the compost the reverse the obtuse and stupid
        And business and business and cheap stupid lyrics
        and simple mass reverse while the real thing is dying

Doug:   Folksy knockwurst
        peel back the skin of French and
        What do you find
        follicles intertwining
        Succulent prose
        wrapped up in rolls

Lou:    Jumpsuit and pig meat and making his fortune
        while making them happy with the inverse and obverse
        And making them happy and making them happy
        with the cloy and the stupid just another dumb lackey
        Who puts out the one thing while singing the other
        but the real things alone and it is no man's brother

Doug:   Safety is nice
        not an unwise word spoken
        Scary bad dreams
        made safe and lovely songs
        No doom of gloom
        allowed in this room

Lou:    Oh not to be whistled or studied or hummed
        or remembered at nights when the eye is alone
        But to skewer and ravage and savage and split
        with the grace of a diamond and bellicose wit
        To stun and to stagger with words of such stone
        that those who do hear cannot again return home

Doug:   Hello to Ray
        hello to Godiva and Angel
        Who let you in
        isn't it nice the party
        Aren't the lights
        pretty at night

Lou:    Contempt, contempt and contempt for the seething
        for writhing and reeling and two bit reportage
        For sick whit the body and sinister holy
        the drowned burst babies now dead on the seashore
        The valourous horseman who hand from the ceiling
        the pig on the carpet the dusty pale jissom
        That has no effect for the sick with the seesaw
        the inverse obverse converse reverse of inverse
        The diverse and converse of reverse and perverse
        and sweet pyrotechnics and let's have another
        Of inverse converse diverse perverse and reverse
        hells graveyard is damned as they chew on their brains
        The slick and the scum reverse inverse and perverse


Lou:    Sick upon the staircase
        sick upon the carpet
        blood upon the pillow
        climb into the parapet

        See the church bells gleaming
        knife that scrapes a sick plate
        dentures full of air holes
        the tailor couldn't mend straight

        Shoot her full of air holes
        climbing up the casket
        take me to the casket
        teeth upon her red throat

        Screw me in the daisies
        rip apart her holler
        snip the seas fantastic
        treat her like a sailor

        Full and free and nervous
        out to make his fortune
        either this or that way
        sickly or in good health

        Piss upon a building
        like a dog in training
        teach to heel or holler
        yodel on a sing song

        Down upon the carpet
        tickle polyester
        sick within the parapet
        screwing for a dollar

        Sucking on a fire hose
        chewing on a rubber line
        tied to chair and rare bits
        pay another player

        Oh your such a good led
        here's another dollar
        tie him to the bedpost
        sick with witches covens

        Craving for raw meat
        bones upon the metal
        sick upon the circle
        down upon the carpet

        Down below the parapet
        waiting for your bidding
        pig upon the carpet
        tumescent railroad

        Neuro-anesthesia analog
        ready for a good look
        drooling at the birches
        swinging from the birches

        Succulent Nebraska

        [left channel]

Sterl:  Candy screen wrappers of silk-screen fantastic
        requiring memories, both lovely and guiltfree
        lurid and lovely with twilight of ages
        luscious and lovely and filthy with laughter
        Laconic giggles, ennui for the passions
        in order to justify most spurious desires
        rectify moments most serious and urgent
        to hail upon the face of most odious time
        Requiring replies most facile and vacuous
        with words nearly singed with the heartbeat of passions
        spew forth with the grace of a tart going under
        subject of great concern, noble origin

Moe:    Please raise the flag
        Rosy red carpet envy
        English used here
        this messenger is nervous
        It's no fun at all
        out here in the hall

Sterl:  For screeching and yelling and various offenses
        lower the queen and bend her over the tub
        against the state, the country, the committee
        hold her head under the water please for an hour
        For groveling and spewing and various offenses
        puncture the bloat with the wing of a sparrow
        the inverse, the obverse, the converse, the reverse
        the sharpening wing of the edge of a sparrow
        For suitable reckonings too numerous to mention
        as the queen is fat she is devoured by rats
        there is one way to skin a cat or poison a rat
        it is hetero four hear to three forthrightly stated

Moe:    Put down the rag
        simpering callow and morose
        Who let you in
        if I knew then I could get out
        The murder you see
        is a mystery to me

Sterl:  To Rembrandt and Oswald, to peanuts and ketchup
        sanctimonious sycophants stir in the bushes
        up to the stand with your foot on the bible
        as king I must order and constantly arouse
        If you swear to catch up and throw up and up-up
        a king full of virgin kiss me and spin it
        excuse me to willow and wander dark wonders
        divest me of robes-sutures Harry and pig meat
        The fate of a nation rests hard on your bosoms
        the king on his throne puts his hand down his robe
        the torture of inverse and silk screen and Harry
        and set the tongue squealing, the reverse and inverse

Moe:    Objection suffice
        apelike and tactile bassoon
        Oboeing me
        cordon that virus' section
        Off to the left
        is what is not right

Sterl:  Contempt, contempt and contempt for the boredom
        I shall poison the city and sink it with fire
        for Cordless and Harry and Apepig and Scissor
        the messenger's wig seems fraught with desire
        For blueberry picnics and pince-nez and magpies
        the messenger's skirt, would you please hook it higher
        for children and adults all those under ninety
        how truly disgusting, would you please put it down
        A stray in this fray is no condom worth saving
        as king I'm quite just, but it's just quite impossible
        a robe and a robe and a robe and a bat
        no double class inverse could make lying worth dying

Moe:    Accept the pig
        enter the Owl and Gorgeous
        King on the left
        it on the right and primping
        Adjusting his nose
        as he reads from his scroll

Sterl:  Off with his head, take his head from his neck off
        requiring memories both lovely and guiltfree
        put out his eyes, then cut his nose off
        sanctimonious sycophants stir in the bushes
        Scoop out his brain, put a string where his ears were
        all the king's horses and all the king's men
        swing the whole mess at the end of the wire
        scratch out his eyes with the tip of a razor
        The wire extend from the tip of a rose
        Caroline, Caroline, Caroline, oh
        but retains the remnants of what once was a nose
        pass me my robe, fill my bath up with water

Moe:    No one knows
        no nose is good news and senseless
        Extend the wine
        drink here toast to selfless
        Ten year old port
        is perfect in court

Sterl:  Casbah and Cascade and Rosehip and Feeling
        Cascade and Cyanide, Rachaminoff, Beethoven
        skull silly wagon and justice and perverse
        reverse the inverse and inverse and inverse
        Blueberry catalog, questionable earnings
        hustler's lament and the rest will in due cry
        to battle and scramble and browbeat and hurt
        while chewing on minstrels and choking on dirt
        Disease please seems the order of the day
        please the king, please the king, please the king day
        Casbah and Cascade and Rosehip and Feeling
        point of order return the king here to the ceiling

Moe:    Razzmatazz
        there's nothing on my shoulder
        Lust is a must
        shaving my head's made me bolder
        Will you kindly read
        what it was I brought thee

Sterl:  Sick leaf, sorrow, pincers net-scissors
        regard and refrain from the daughters of marriage
        Regards for the elders and youngest in carriage
        regard and regard for the inverse and perverse
        And obverse and diverse of reverse and reverse
        regard from the sick, the dumb and the camel
        From pump's storing water, like brain is too marrow
        to x-ray and filthy and cutting and peeling
        To skin and to skin and to bone and to structure
        to livid and pallid and turgid and structured
        And structured and structured and structured and structured
        and regard and refrain and regard and refrain
        The sick and the dumb, inverse, reverse and perverse


Doug:   Plowing while it's done anyway
        dumb and ready pig meat
        sick upon the carpet
        climb into the casket

        Safe within the parapet
        sack is in the parapet
        pigs are out and growling
        slaughter by the seashore

        See the lifeguard drowning
        sea is full of fishes
        fishes full of China
        China plates are falling

        All fall down
        sick and shimmy carpets
        rise before my eyes-eyes
        lead me to the ceiling

        Walk upon the wall-wall
        tender as the green grass
        drink the whiskey horror
        see the young girls dancing

        Flies upon the beaches
        beaches are for sailors
        nuns across the sea wall
        black hood horseman raging

        Swordsmen eating fire
        fire on the carpet
        set the house a blazing
        seize and bring it flaming

        Gently to the ground-ground
        dizzy bell Miss Fortune
        fat and full of love juice
        drip it on the carpet

        Down below the fire hose
        weep and whiskey fortune
        sail me to the moon dear
        drunk and dungeon sailors

        Headless Roman horseman
        the king and queen are empty
        their heads are in the outhouse
        fish upon the water

        Bowl upon the savior
        toothless wigged laureate
        plain of bull and fancy
        name upon a letter head

        Impressing all the wheat germ
        love you for a nickel
        maul you for a quarter
        set the casket flaming

        Do not go gentle blazing

        My baby left me
        oh, she left me

"My Friend George"
======================
album _New Sensations_
(Lou Reed, 1984)

written by Lou Reed
======================


        Read in the paper 'bout a man killed with a sword
        and that made my think of my friend George
        People said the man was five foot six
        sounds like George with his killing stick

        Hey bro, what's the word
        talkin' 'bout my friend George
        Hey bro, what's the word
        talkin' 'bout my friend George
        You talkin' 'bout my friend George

        I knew George since he's eight
        I always thought that he was great
        And anything that George would do
        you know that I would do it too

        George liked music and George liked to fight
        he worked out in a downtown gym every night
        I'd spar with him when work was done
        we split lips but it was all in fun

        Hey bro, what's the word
        you talkin' 'bout my friend George
        Hey bro, what's the word
        talkin' 'bout my friend George
        Talkin' 'bout my friend George

        Next thing I hear George's got this stick
        he's using it for more than kicks
        I seen him down at Smalley's bar
        he was wired up, I tried to calm him down

        Avenge yourself he says to me
        avenge yourself for humanity
        Avenge yourself for the weak and the poor
        stick it to these guys right through their heads

        Well, the fight is my music, the stick is my sword
        and you know that I love you, so please don't say a word
        Can't you hear the music playing, the anthem, it's my call
        and the last I seen of George was him
        running through the door, I says -

        Hey bro, what's the word
        talkin' 'bout my friend George
        Hey bro, what's the word
        you talkin' 'bout my friend George
        Talkin' 'bout my friend George

        Hey bro, what's the word
        you talkin' 'bout my friend George
        Hey bro, what's the word
        what me saying 'bout my friend George
        Hey bro, what's the word
        hear you talkin' 'bout my friend George
        Hey bro, what's the word
        I hear talkin' 'bout my friend George

"My House"
=====================
album _The Blue Mask_
(Lou Reed, 1982)

written by Lou Reed
=====================


        The image of the poet's in the breeze
        Canadian geese are flying above the trees
        A mist is hanging gently on the lake
        my house is very beautiful at night

        My friend and teacher occupies a spare room
        he's dead, at peace at last the wandering Jew
        Other friends had put stones on his grave
        he was the first great man that I had ever met

        Sylvia and I got out our Ouija Board
        to dial a spirit, across the room it soared
        We were happy and amazed at what we saw
        blazing stood the proud and regal name Delmore

        Delmore, I missed all your funny ways
        I missed your jokes and the brilliant things you said
        My Daedalus to your Bloom, was such a perfect wit
        and to find you in my house makes things perfect

        I've really got a lucky life
        my writing, my motorcycle and my wife
        And to top it all off a spirit of pure poetry
        is living in this stone and wood house with me

        The image of the poet's in the breeze
        Canadian geese are flying above the trees
        A mist is hanging gently on the lake
        our house is very beautiful at night

        Our house is very beautiful at night
        our house is very beautiful at night
        Our house is very beautiful at night

"My Love Is Chemical"
===========================
album _White Nights_
(Original Soundtrack, 1985)

written by Walt Aldridge
===========================


        When I see the way you paint your lips
        and I smell your perfume
        when I see the brand new color
        that you've dyed your hair, too
        I know, you know, it's more than physical
        My love, my love, my love, love is chemical

        Well I know the saying goes
        that all in love and war is fair
        but I've never stood a chance
        against your chemical warfare
        The polish on your fingernails
        mascara on your eyes
        the lotion you rub on at night
        to make sure your hands ain't dry
        My love, my love, my love, love is chemical

        (My, my, my love is chemical)
        (my, my, my love is chemical)
        I know, I know, it's more than physical, hey baby
        My love, my love, my love, love is chemical

        Well I hope that you won't take offense
        it's not that you're not pretty
        it's only that I feel like
        I'm in love with test tube city
        I know with you, I'm on the pinnacle
        I'm on the pinnacle, babe
        My love, my love, my love, love is chemical
        we're not just talking physical desire here

        (My, my, my love is chemical)
        (my, my, my love is chemical)
        I know with you, it's more than physical
        much more than just carnal lust
        My love, my love, my love, love is chemical

        My, my love, oh, love is chemical
        my, my, my love is chemical
        It's so much more than physical, honey
        it's much more than physical
        My love, my love, my love, love is chemical

        My, my, my, my love is chemical
        hey baby, my, my, my, my love is chemical
        So much more than physical, honey, why don't you come here
        my love is chemical
        I'd like to communicate with you directly
        my love is chemical

        I know with you, I'm on the pinnacle
        I'm on the pinnacle, babe
        My love, my love, my love, love is chemical
        we're not just talking physical desire here

        (my, my, my love is chemical)
        I know with you, it's more than physical
        much more than just carnal lust

"Love is Chemical"


When I see the way you pink your lips
and I smell your perfume
When I see the brand new color
that you've dyed your hair too

I know, you know, it's more than physical
My love, my love, my love
love is chemical

Well, i know the same ain't goes there...love, wow, is fair
But I've never stood a chance to kiss your chemical...
The...your fingernails, mascara on your eyes,
the lotion you robbed on a night to make sure...

My love, my love , my love
Love is chemical

Ah, ah, ah love is chemical
I know, I know, I know
it's more than physical
My love, my love , my love
love is chemical

Well, I hope that you don't take offense
it's not that you're not pretty
It's only that I feel like I'm in love with...city
I know with you, I'm on the pinnacle baby

My love, my love, my love
love is chemical

i know with you it's more than physical
it's so much more than physical

(repeat, fade out)

Here are some corrections to the lyrics...



When I see the way you paint your lips and I smell your perfume
when I see the brand new color that you've dyed your hair, too
I know, you know, it's more than physical
My love, my love, my love, love is chemical

Well, i know the siying goes that all in love and war is fair,
but I've never stood a chance against your chemical war-fare
The polish your fingernails, the mascara on your eyes
the lotion you rub on a night to make sure your hands aint dry
My love, my love, my love, love is chemical

My - ah - ah, love is chemical
my - ah - ah, love is chemical
I know, I know, it's more than physical, hey, baby
My love, my love, my love, love is chemical

Well, I hope that you don't take offenses
it's not that you're not pretty
it's only that I feel like I'm in love with test tube city
I know, with you, I'm on the pinnacle
come on, pinnacle, baby
My love, my love, my love, love is chemical
when I just talk ...

My - ah - ah, love is chemical
my - ah - ah, love is chemical
I know, with you, it's more than physical
watch ... just ...
My love, my love, my love, love is chemical

My, my love, oh, love is chemical
my, my, my, love is chemical
It's so much more than physical
it's much more than physical
My love, my love, my love, love is chemical

My, my, my, my love is chemical
hey, baby, my-my-my, my love is chemical
So much more than physical, honey, ... me
my love is chemical
I like the music ...
my love is chemical

        there is no question that I am it, hey girl

===================================
"My Old Man"
===================================
album _Growing Up In Public_
(Lou Reed, 1980)

written by Lou Reed/Michael Fonfara
===================================


        When I was a young boy in Brooklyn
        going to public school
        During recess in the concrete playground
        they lined us up by twos
        In alphabetical order, Reagan, Reed and Russo
        I still remember the names
        And stickball and stoopball were the only games
        that we played

        And I wanted to be like my old man
        I, I wanted to grow up just like my old man
        I wanted to be like my old man

        I wanted to dress like, I wanted to be just like
        I wanted to act like my old man
        I wanted to be like, I wanted to act like
        I wanted to be just like my old man

        And then like everyone else I started to grow
        And I didn't want to be like my father anymore
        I was sick of his bullying
        and having to hide under a desk on the floor
        And when he beat my mother
        it made me so mad I could choke

        And I didn't want to be like my old man
        I, I didn't even want to look like my old man
        I didn't even want to seem like my old man

        A son watches his father, being cruel to his mother
        and makes a vow to return only when
        He is so much richer, in every way so much bigger that -
        - the old man will never hit anyone again

        Like my old man (just like my old man)
        like my old man
        Like my old man (just like my old man)
        like my old man
        and can you believe what he said to me
        he said, "Lou, act like a man" (walk like a man)
        Why don't you act just like a man
        act like your daddy, act like a man (just like my old man)
        Oh, why don't you act just like a man
        like your old man (walk like a man)
        (Just like my old man)
        (Just like my old man)

My Old Man
 
When I was a young boy in Brooklyn
Going to public school
During recess in the concrete playground
They lined us up by twos
In alphabetical order, Reagan, Reed and Russo
I still remember the names
And stickball and stoopball
Were the only games that we played
And I wanted to be like my old man
I wanted to grow up just like my old man
I wanted to be like my old man
I wanted to dress like
I wanted to be just like
I wanted to act like my old man
I wanted to be like
I wanted to act like
I wanted to be just like my old man

And then like everyone else I started to grow
And I didn't want to be like my father anymore
I was sick if his bullying
And having to hide under a desk on the floor
And when he beat my mother
It made me so mad I could choke
And I didn't want to be like my old man
I didn't even want to look like my old man
I didn't even want to seem like my old man

A son watches his father
Being cruel to his mother
And makes a vow to return only when
He is so much richer
In every way so much bigger
That the old man will never hit anyone again

Like my old man
Like my old man
Like my old man
Like my old man

And can you believe what he said to me
He said, "Lou, act like a man"
Why don't you act just like a man
Act like your daddy
Act like a man
Why don't you act like a man
Like your old man

Like my old man

"My Red Joystick"
======================
album _New Sensations_
(Lou Reed, 1984)

written by Lou Reed
======================


        The first bite of the apple made Eve smart
        the second bite taught her how to break men's hearts
        The third bite taught her how to strut her stuff
        but she never got to the fourth bite that says
        enough is enough

        Enough is enough, baby, I've had enough of you
        you can keep your dresses, you can keep your jewels
        You can keep the color TV, those soaps just make me sick
        all I'm asking you to leave me is my red joystick

        My red joystick, my red joystick
        all I'm asking you to leave me is my red joystick
        My red joystick, my red joystick
        all I'm asking you to leave me is my red joystick

        Eve kissed Able, that's how he got murdered by Cain
        Abraham gave up his son to keep his wife away
        And even the Lord almighty
        speaking from the trenches to the pits
        spoke for all mankind when he said

        Take the Porsche, take the kids
        take the stocks, baby take the rugs
        Take those roses from my poor heart wilting
        but please, please, please leave me my red joystick

        Leave me my red joystick
        leave me my red joystick
        Leave me my red joystick

        Eve drank apple cider, Eve brewed good apple wine
        Eve cooked up stewed apples, knew how to have a good time
        She came into the bedroom, raised her skirts up high
        she said, "If a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, baby
        give me a piece before I die"

        Hey, Eve take a bite of my apple
        I know you think you're pretty slick
        the one thing I ask you to leave me is my red joystick

        My red joystick, ooohhh, my red joystick
        all I'm asking you to leave me is my red joystick
        My red joystick, baby, my red joystick
        all I'm asking you to leave me is my red joystick

        My red joystick
        leave me my red joystick
        Ooohhh, my red joystick
        please leave me my red joystick
        Oh, my red joystick

"Mystic Child"
===================
album _Ecstasy_
(Lou Reed, 2000)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        It was only the time of the newly born dead
        with wispy cobwebs in your head
        the polar moon looked out instead
        goin' wild

        Liquor shifting through the brain
        the manic depressive goes insane
        goin' wild
        goin' wild

        Desperate anger hits the streets
        by the foul smelling river by the meat market
        goin' wild
        mystic child

        Goin' wild
        mystic child

        In the winter with frozen toes
        looking out the big windows
        to fly
        goin' wild

        Situation X out of control
        my eyes half opened like a mole
        who smiles
        goin' wild

        Who smiles
        goin' wild

        In the mystic morning where the river meets
        the hurdy-gurdy of the hip-hop beat
        5 a.m. the viscous street

        Oh, wild
        goin' wild

        Out the window like a flash
        fallin' through a rooftop crash
        blind
        goin' wild

        Sick and misty like a pup by the curb
        he's throwin' up
        wild
        like a child

        Goin' wild
        like a child

        If he can't have all that relates
        to testify that he is great
        he'll cut someone with a broken plate
        stand upon the subway grate

        And smile
        goin' wild
        goin' wild
        with a smile

        Holy morning
        sun is up and someone
        here has lost his cups

        The dawn is tattered all cut up
        goin' wild
        like a mystic child

        Like a mystic child

        Sunday morning looking down from the rooftop
        goin' wild with a smile
        mystic child

        Top of the world he's got it made
        rings are gold, braids are jade
        jumped to the street, he's got it made
        goodbye, child

        Goodbye, child
        mystic child
        goin' wild
        like a mystic child

        Goodbye
        goodbye
        Goin' wild, ah
        goin' wild
        Like a mystic child
        holy morning
        sun is up and someone
        Going wild
        like a mystic, like a mystic, like a mystic -
        - Child
        goin'-goin', goin'-goin' wild
        Like a mystic child
        Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
        Oh-oh-oh, oh
        Jumped to the street
        Goodbye my mystic child

Mystic Child
-------------

It was only the time of the newly born dead
with wispy cobwebs in your head
The polar moon looked out instead
going wild

Liquor shifting through the brain
The manic-depressive goes insane
going wild, going wild

Desperate anger hits the streets
by the foul smelling river by the meat market
going wild
mystic child
going wild
mystic child

In the winter with frozen toes
Looking out the big windows
you fly
going wild

Situation x out of control
My eyes half opened like a mole
who smiles
going wild
who smiles
going wild

In the mystic morning where the river meets
the hurdy-gurdy of the hip hop beat
5 a.m. the viscous street
Oh wild
going wild

Out the window like a flash
Falling through the rooftop crash
blind
going wild

Sick and misty like a pup by the curb he's
throwin' up
wild
like a child
going wild
like a child

He can't have all that relates
to testify that he is great
He'll cut someone with a broken plate
and stand upon the subway grate
and smile
going wild
going wild
with a smile

Holy morning
sun is up and someone
here has lost his cups
The dawn is tattered all cut up
going wild
like a mystic child
like a mystic child

Sunday morning looking down from the rooftop
goin wild
with a smile
mystic child

Top of the world he's got it made
His rings are gold his braids are jade
He jumped to the street
He's got it made
Goodbye child
goodbye child
mystic child
going wild

Like a mystic child
Goodbye
Goodbye
Going wild
Going wild
like a mystic child
Early morning, the sun is gone
Going wild
like a mystic, like a mystic, like a mystic child
Going, going, going, going, going
like a mystic child

ooooooohhhh, ooooooohhh
don't you see

        Can I have your autograph
        he said to the fat blonde actress
        You know I've seen every movie you've been in
        from "Paths of Pain" to "Jewels of Glory"

        And when you kissed Robert Mitchum
        gee, but I thought you'd never catch him

        Over the hill right now
        and you're looking for love
        You're over the hill right now
        and you're looking for love

        I'll come running to you
        honey, when you want me
        I'll come running to you
        honey, when you want me

        Can I have your autograph
        he said to the fat blonde actress
        You know I know everything you've done
        anyway I hate divorces

        To the left is a marble shower
        it was fun even for an hour, but

        You're over the hill right now
        and you're looking for love
        You're over the hill right now
        and you're looking for love

        I'll come running to you
        honey, when you want me
        I'll come running to you
        honey, when you want me

        Something's got a hold on me
        and I don't know what
        Oh, something's got a hold on me
        and I don't know what

        It's the beginning of a new age
        It's the beginning of a new age
        it's a new age

        Waiting for the phone to ring
        diamond necklace on my shoulder

i just thought id mention a slight error
in your transcription of 'new age',
the original 'loaded' version.
in the bridge you have the chords listed as all E's,
but in fact it should read like so:

{E/A(onE)}{D(onE)/E}
{E/A(onE)}{D(onE)/E}

inasmuch as the chords read:

A/E   - 077600
D/E   - 00777X

i am fairly confident that this is indeed what
lou/sterling plays on loaded.

"New Sensations"

album _New Sensations_
(Lou Reed, 1984)

written by Lou Reed
======================


        I don't like guilt be it stoned or stupid
        drunk and disorderly I ain't no cupid
        Two years ago today I was arrested on Christmas Eve

        I don't want pain, I want to walk not be carried
        I don't want to give it up, I want to stay married
        I ain't no dog tied to a parked car

        Ooohhh, new sensations
        Ooohhh, new sensations

        Talkin' 'bout some new sensations
        Talkin' 'bout some new sensations

        I want the principles of a timeless muse
        I want to eradicate my negative views
        And get rid of those people who are always on a down

        It's easy enough to tell what is wrong
        but that's not what I want to hear all night long
        Some people are like human Tuinals

        Ooohhh, new sensations
        Ooohhh, ooohhh, new sensations

        Talkin' 'bout some new sensations
        Talkin' a new sensations

        I took my GPZ out for a ride
        the engine felt good between my thighs
        The air felt cool, it was forty degrees outside

        I rode to Pennsylvania near the Delaware Gap
        sometimes I got lost and had to check the map
        I stopped at a roadside diner for a burger and a coke

        There were some country folk and some hunters inside
        somebody got themselves married and somebody died
        I went to the juke box and played a hillbilly song

        They was arguing about football as I waved and went outside
        and I headed for the mountains feeling warm inside
        I love that GPZ so much, you know that I could kiss her

        Ooohhh, new sensations
        Ooohhh, ooohhh, new sensations

        Talkin' 'bout your new sensations
        Talkin' new sensations

        Ooohhh, new sensations
        Ooohhh, new sensations
        Ooohhh, new sensations
        Ooohhh, new sensations
        Ooohhh, new sensations

"New Sensations"
====================================
album _Perfect Night Live In London_
(Lou Reed, 1998)

Jul 03, 1997
Royal Festival Hall, London
(Meltdown Festival)
====================================


        Ah
        I don't like guilt be it stoned or stupid
        drunk and disorderly I ain't no cupid
        Two years ago today I got arrested on big Christmas Eve

        I want to walk, baby, not be carried
        I don't want to give it up
        Ah, maybe I'm not meant to be married
        you know I'm no dog tied and put in a parked car

        Oh, new sensation, I wanna new sensation
        Ooohhh, ooohhh, now new sensation

        I said, I'm talkin' 'bout some new sensations
        I said, I'm talkin' about a new sensation

        I want the benefits of a timeless muse
        I want to get rid of my negative views
        And get rid of those people that are always such a down

        It's easy enough to say what's wrong
        that ain't what I want to hear all night long
        Some people are like human Tuinals

        Ooohhh, now baby, new sensation
        Oh, now new sensation

        I said, talkin' the new sensation
        I said, new sensation

        I took that GPZ out for a ride
        engine felt so good between my thighs
        The air was cool, forty degrees outside

        Rode to Pennsylvania by the Delaware Gap
        you know Michael, sometimes I got lost and check the map
        Went over a roadside diner
        for a scotch and a beer and a coke
        little boiler maker

        Some country folk, some hunters sitting inside
        somebody got married, somebody lay died
        Went to the juke box and I played, I played a hillbilly song

        They were arguing about soccer as I went outside
        heading for the mountains feeling warm inside
        You know I love my GPZ so much, I could kiss her

        Oh, a new sensation, I wanna new sensation
        Oh baby, a new sensation

        I said, I'm talkin' about a new sensation
        I wanna new sensation, new sensation
        Rip it open on the parkway, baby
        floor down a hundred and five, ah, I wanna new sensation

        I wanna go faster, baby
        Oh new-new, I wanna new sensation
        faster, baby, a hundred and five
        Crack it over, crack it motherfucker over
        crack it over, crack it motherfucker over
        I wanna hundred, a hundred and five, don't stop it now
        I said that new, new, new, new
        I said new sensation, I want a new sensation now
        ooohhh baby-baby-baby
        ah, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-now
        A new, a new, a new, baby, please, new, new, new sensation

I think that there is a line in New Sensations that is incorrect.
"Some people are like human toulinols".
Toulinol is a barbitiuate type medication.
I'm not trying to be critical, just helpful!

version from the Perfect Night concert.
I send you my transcription.

Two years ago today I got arrested on big Christmas Eve

line 15:
And get rid of those people that are always such a down

line 17:
that aint what I want to hear all night long

line 27:
you know, Michael, sometimes I got lost and check the map

Rip it over on the parkway, baby

Crack it over mother fucker, crack it mother fucker over

in my opinion,
Lou says "some people are like human ruinals" in "New sensations".

---------------------------------------------------------------------

I think I've found some minor inaccuracies
in 'New Sensations' (live version).

Namely:

line 8: I ain't no dog tied and put in a parked car
line 13: I want the benefits of a timeless muse
line 33: They were arguing about soccer as I went outside
line 34: Heading for the mountains feeling warm inside
line 40: Rip it open ot the parkway, baby

---------------------------------------------------------------------

There seems to be a lot of confusion over the line,
"Some People are like human toulinols". That is correct.
What Lou meant is that some people, due to their negative attitudes,
can affect someone like a toulinol in that they suck positive energy.
I know we all know people like this.

On your lyrics for new sensations,
the verse where you say little boy america,
I believe he is saying a little boiler maker,
which is a whisky and a beer (not a scotch)

thanks: Stephen Botha (gbotha@worldonline.co.za)

One tiny correction for "New Sensations"
- I'm pretty sure that the line
"human toulinols" should be "human Tuinals."

"New York Telephone Conversation"
=================================
album _Transformer_
(Lou Reed, 1972)

written by Lou Reed
=================================


        I was sleeping gently napping
        when I heard the phone
        Who is on the other end talking
        am I even home

        Did you see what she did to him
        did you hear what they said
        Just a New York conversation
        rattling in my head

        Oh, oh, my, and what shall we wear
        Oh, oh, my, and who really cares

        Just a New York conversation
        gossip all of the time
        Did you hear who did what to whom
        happens all the time

        Who has touched and who has dabbled
        here in the city of shows
        Openings, closings, bad repartee
        everybody knows

        Oh, how sad and why do we call
        Oh, I'm glad to hear from you all

        I am calling, yes I'm calling
        just to speak to you
        For I know this night will kill me
        if I can't be with you

        If I can't be with you

In the version on your website the last line of this song
(if I can't be with you..) has the chords;

{ A / G#m }  { F#m / B }  { E...

The G#m should be an E played with a G# bass.
There is only one note difference
(E rather than Eb in the right hand)
but it does make a difference.

"No Chance - Regret"
======================
album _Magic And Loss_
(Lou Reed, 1992)

written by Lou Reed
======================


        It must be nice to be steady
        it must be nice to be firm
        it must be nice never to move off the mark

        It must be nice to be dependable
        and never let anyone down
        it must be great to be all the things you're not
        It must be great to be all the things that I'm not

        I see you in the hospital
        your humor is intact
        I'm embarrassed by the strength I seem to lack

        If I was in your shoes
        so strange that I am not
        I'd fold up in a minute and a half
        I'd fold up in a minute and a half

        And I didn't
        get a chance to say goodbye
        No, I didn't
        get a chance to say goodbye

        It must be nice to be normal
        it must be nice to be cold
        it must be nice not to have to go, oh, up or down

        But me I'm all emotional
        no matter how I try
        you're gone and I'm still here alive
        You're gone and I am still here alive

        And I didn't
        get a chance to say goodbye
        No, I didn't
        get a chance to say goodbye

        There are things we say, we wish, we knew
        and in fact we never do
        but I wish I'd known that you were going to die

        Then I wouldn't feel so stupid
        such a fool that I didn't call
        and I didn't get a chance to say goodbye
        I didn't get a chance to say goodbye

        No there's no logic to this
        who's picked to stay or go
        if you think too hard it only makes you mad

        But your optimism made me think
        you really had it beat
        so I didn't get a chance to say goodbye
        I didn't get a chance to say goodbye
        No, I didn't get a chance to say goodbye
        I didn't get a chance to say goodbye

"No Money Down"
===================
album _Mistrial_
(Lou Reed, 1986)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        I know you're disappointed
        in the way I handled things
        You're thinking I misread the times
        and acted cowardly
        And since what I do affects us both
        and you feel that I let you down

        You're paying a price when there's no price to pay
        lovers trust, no money down
        You're paying a price when there's no price to pay
        it's a lover's trust, no money down

        (Hey, lovers)
        (Hey, lovers)
        (lovers)

        They say there's someone for everyone
        and for everyone a someone
        And some tattoo roses across their chests
        with a heart that says Rollo
        And some work without a public relations man
        and do their best work, babe, out of sight

        You're paying a price when there's no price to pay
        it's a lover's trust, no money down
        You're paying a price when there's no price to pay
        lovers trust, no money down

        (Hey, lovers)
        (Hey, lovers)
        (lovers)

        Now I have known a hero or two
        and they all learn to swim through mud
        And they all got boots caked with dirty soles
        that they get from squashing bugs
        So when push comes to shove get the Harley revved up
        the moon can eclipse even the sun

        You're paying a price when there's no price to pay
        lovers trust, no money down
        You're paying a price when there's no price to pay
        it's a lover's trust, no money down

        Lovers trust, no money down (Hey, lovers)
        It's a lover's trust, no money down (Hey, lovers)
        mmmm..
        Lovers trust, no money down (Hey, hey, lovers)
        Lovers trust, no money down (Hey, hey, lovers)

"No Money Down"

I know you're disappointed
in the way I handled things
You're thinking I misread the times
and acted cowardly
and since what I do affects us both
and you feel that I let you down

You're paying a price
When there is no price to pay
Lovers Trust----No Money Down

They say there's someone for everyone
and for everyone a someone
and some tattoo roses across their chests
with a heart that says Rollo
and some work without a Public Relations man
And do their best work
Baby out of sight

You're paying a price
When there is no price to pay
Lovers Trust----No Money Down

Now I have known a hero or two
And they all learn to swim through mud
And they all got boots caked with
Dirty soles that they get from
Squashing bugs
So when push comes to shove
Get the Harley revved up
The moon can eclipse even the sun

You're paying a price
When there is no price to pay
Lovers Trust----No Money Down

"Nobody But You"
=============================
album _Songs For Drella_
(Lou Reed/John Cale, 1990)

written by Lou Reed/John Cale
=============================


        I really care a lot
        although I look like I do not
        Since I was shot
        there's nobody but you

        I know I look blas&eacute;
        party Andy's what the papers say
        At dinner I'm the one who pays
        for a nobody like you

        Nobody but you
        a nobody like you
        Since I got shot
        there's nobody but you

        Won't you decorate my house
        I'll sit there quiet as a mouse
        You know me I like to look a lot
        at nobody but you

        I'll hold your hand and slap my face
        I'll tickle you to your disgrace
        Won't you put me in my proper place
        a nobody like you

        Sundays I pray a lot
        I'd like to wind you up and paint your clock
        I want to be what I am not
        for a nobody like you

        The bullet split my spleen and lung
        the doctors said I was gone
        Inside I've got some shattered bone
        for nobody but you

        Nobody but you
        a nobody like you
        Shattered bone
        for nobody but you

        I'm still not sure I didn't die
        and if I'm dreaming I still have bad pains inside
        I know I'll never be a bride
        to nobody like you

        I wish I had a stronger chin
        my skin was good, my nose was thin
        This is no movie I'd ask to be in
        with a nobody like you

        Nobody like you
        a nobody like you
        All my life

        It's been nobodies like you

        Hey, if you're moving too fast

"Now And Then"
=========================
unreleased live
(Lou Reed, 1994)

written by Pete Townshend

Feb 19, 1994
Shrine Auditorium, LA
=========================


        Now and then you see a soul and you fall in love
        you can't do a thing about it
        Now and then you see a soul and you fall in love
        you can't do a thing about it
        Now and then you see a soul and you fall in love
        you can't do a thing about it
        Now and then you see a soul and you fall in love
        you can't do a thing about it

        In you I saw someone
        that I recognized
        Had no idea
        what was in your mind
        I met your eyes
        and I was hypnotized
        I let our lives
        become entwined

        Now and then you see a soul and you fall in love
        you can't do a thing about it
        Now and then you see a soul and you fall in love
        you can't do a thing about it
        Now and then you see a soul and you fall in love
        you can't do a thing about it
        Now and then you see a soul and you fall in love
        you can't do a thing about it
        take it, Rob

        Now and then you see a soul and you fall in love
        you can't do a thing about it
        Now and then you see a soul and you fall in love
        you can't do a thing about it

        For though you knew that I was twice your age
        make you laugh seemed you enough
        I thought we'd love and then and
        turn the page, to suffer your rebuff
        And it was me who had the most to gain despite the fact that
        I now have lost
        The only love that ever caused me pain
        I feel like I was double ....

        Now and then you see a soul and you fall in love
        you can't do a thing about it
        Now and then you see a soul and you fall in love
        you can't do a thing about it
        Now and then you see a soul and you fall in love
        you can't do a thing about it
        Now and then you see a soul and you fall in love
        you can't do a thing about it

        The stock is empty
        in our eyeball store
        All we got left
        a few cataracts and sores
        The faggot mimic machine
        never had ideas
        Mission impossible
        they self-destruct on fear

        On a standard New York night
        ghouls go to see their so-called stars
        A fairly stupid thing
        to pay five bucks for fourth-rate imitators

        They say, "I'm so empty
        no surface, no depth
        Oh please can't I be you
        your personality's so great"

        Like new buildings
        square, tall and the same
        Sorry, Miss Stupid
        didn't know, you didn't know it's a game
        I'm just waiting
        for them to hurry up and die
        It's really getting too crowded here
        help your New York Stars

        Contributions accepted all the same
        We need a new people store
        remember we're very good at games

"NYC Man"
================================
album _Set The Twilight Reeling_
(Lou Reed, 1996)

written by Lou Reed
================================


        It can only lead to trouble if you break my heart
        if you accidentally crush it on the Ides of March
        I'd prefer you were straightforward
        you don't have to go through all of that
        I'm a New York City man, baby
        and say, "Go" and that is that

        New York City man
        you just say, "Go" and that is that
        I'm a New York City man
        you just say, "Go" and that is that

        It's far too complicated, mmmm.., to make up a lie
        that you'd have to remember and really why
        I wouldn't want to be around you
        if you didn't want to have me around
        I'm a M-A-N-N man
        you blink your eyes and I'll be gone

        M-A-N-N man, you blink your eyes
        honey, I love you, I'll be gone
        New York City man
        you blink your eyes and I'll be gone

        Brutus made a pretty speech but Caesar was betrayed
        Lady Macbeth went crazy but Macbeth ended slain
        Ophelia and Desdamona dead leaving Hamlet in a play
        but I'm no Lear with a blinded eye, say, "Go" and I am gone

        The stars have shut their eyes up tight
        the earth has changed it's course
        a kingdom sits on a black knight's back
        as he tries to mount a white jeweled horse
        While a clock full of butterflies on the hour
        releases a thousand moths
        You say, "Leave" and I'll be gone
        without any remorse
        No letters, faxes, phones or tears
        there's a difference between bad and worse

        I'm a New York City man
        blink your eyes and I'll be gone
        New York City man, M-A-N
        you blink your eyes and I'll be gone

        New York City, I love you
        New York City man
        New York City, how I love you
        blink your eyes and I'll be gone
        just a little grain of sand
        New York City
        ooohhh, how I love you
        New York City, babe
        blink your eyes and you've gone
        Oh, how I love you

"Ocean"
===================
album _Lou Reed_
(Lou Reed, 1972)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        Here comes the ocean
        and the waves down by the sea
        Here comes the ocean
        and the waves where have they been

        Don't swim tonight my love, the sea is mad my love
        it's known to drive men crazy
        Malcolm has burned at sea, the castle it sits and reeks
        the madness can make you hazy

        But here come the waves
        down by the shore
        Washing the rocks that have been here
        centuries or more

        Down by the sea

        Here come the ocean
        and the waves down by the sea
        Here comes the ocean
        and the waves where have they been

        Castles glowing at night, towers above out fright
        warlocks decapitating
        Malcolm he lives on hate, serve your brain on a plate
        feasts on your mouth for dinner

        But here come the waves
        down by the sea
        Washing the eyes of the men
        who have died

        Down by the sea

        Here come the waves
        Here come the waves
        Here come the waves
        Here come the waves

"Ocean"
==================================================
album _1969 Velvet Underground Live With Lou Reed_
(The Velvet Underground, 1974)

Nov 1969
San Francisco, California
==================================================


        Here comes the ocean
        and the waves down by the shore
        Here comes the ocean
        and the waves down by the sea

        Earth is a hollow hair, part of a bigger head
        it nearly drives me crazy
        I am a lazy son, I never get things done
        mostly made up of water

        But here comes the waves
        down by the shore
        Washing the eye of the land
        that has been

        Down by the sea
        down by the sea
        Down by the sea
        down by the sea

        Here comes the ocean
        and the waves down by the shore
        Here comes the ocean
        and the waves down by the sea

        In sex or evil thoughts, fought off by selfish men
        it nearly drives me crazy
        I am a lazy son, I never get things done
        mostly made up of water

        But here comes the waves
        down by the shore
        Washing the eye of the land
        that has been

        Down by the sea
        Down by the sea

        Here come the waves

"Ocean"
==============================
album _VU_
(The Velvet Underground, 1985)

Jun 19, 1969
Record Plant Studios, NY
==============================


        Here comes the ocean
        and the waves down by the sea
        Here comes the ocean
        and the waves crashing in

        Earth is a hollow hair, part of a bigger head
        it nearly drives me crazy
        In the many years, they have small leprechauns
        we caught up all our actions

        And here comes the waves
        down by the shore
        Washing the eye of the land
        that has been

        Down by the sea
        down by the sea
        Down by the sea
        down by the sea

        Here comes the ocean
        and the waves down by the shore
        Here comes the ocean
        and the waves crashing in

        In sex or evil thoughts, fought off by selfish men
        it nearly drives me crazy
        I am a lazy son, I never get things done
        made up mostly of water

        And here comes the waves
        down by the shore
        Washing the eye of the land
        that has been

        Down by the sea
        down by the sea
        Down by the sea
        down by the sea

        Here come the waves
        Here come the waves
        Here come the waves
        Here come the waves

=====================================


        Here comes the ocean
        and the waves down by the sea
        Here comes the ocean
        and the waves where have they been

        Silver and black lit night, here's to a stealer's night
        an empty splendid castle
        Glowering alone at night, the princess has had a fight
        madness seeks out a lover

        And here come the waves
        down by the shore
        Washing the soul of the body
        that comes form the depth of the sea

        Here comes the ocean
        and the waves down by the sea
        Here comes the ocean
        and the waves where have they been

        Don't swim tonight my love, the tide is out my love
        Malcolm's curse haunts our family
        Odious loud and rich, ruler of filthy seas
        revel in heaven's justice

        And here come the waves
        and save for a scream
        There's much like a song to be heard
        in the wind that blows by the sea
        Like the wind

        Here come the waves
        Here come the waves
        Here come the waves
        Here come the waves

        Here comes the ocean
        and the waves where have they been

        Lyin' here on the beach, with you it seems out of reach
        it could just drive me crazy
        You're such a lazy son, but you're the only one
        I could stay here forever

        But here come the waves
        down by the shore
        Washing our eyes then it's gone
        just once more

        Down by the sea

        and the waves where have they been

        Lyin' down on the beach, it seems so out of reach
        does any just drive he crazy
        You know that you feel so strong
        and you know they would be long
        till they stone on the water

        But here come the waves
        down by the shore
        Washing our eyes till it's gone
        just once more

        Down by the sea

        Here come the waves
        Here come the waves
        Here come the waves

One main correction: in Ocean, you have Reed singing 'ho-ho-holler'
or somesuch on a couple of the versions.
The line is, variously, 'mostly made up of water'
and 'made up mostly of water'.

        Oh, treat me this way

===================


        All your two-bit friends
        they're shootin' you up with pills, huh
        They said that it was good for you
        that it would cure your ills

        I don't care just where it's at
        I'm just like an alley cat

        And when you're filled up to here with hate
        don't you know you gotta get it straight
        Filled up to here with hate
        beat her black and blue and get it straight

        Do, do, do, do, do, do
        when you're lookin' through the eyes of hate

        All your two-bit friends
        they asked you for your autograph
        They put you on the stage
        they thought it'd be good for a laugh

        But I don't care just where it's at
        'cause honey, I'm just like an alley cat

        And when you're filled up to here with hate
        don't you know you gotta get it straight
        Filled up to here with hate
        beat her black and blue and get it straight
        Uh huh


        Oh Jim
        how could you treat me this way
        Hey hey hey
        how'd you treat me this way

        Oh Jim
        how could you treat me this way
        Hey hey
        how'd you treat me this way

        You know you broke my heart
        ever since you went away

        Now you said that you love us
        but you only make love to one of us
        Oh oh oh oh Jim
        how could you treat me this way

        You know you broke my heart
        ever since you went away

        When you're looking through the eyes of hate
        oh oh oh oh
        When you're looking through the eyes of hate
        oh oh oh oh
        When you're looking through the eyes of hate

        Say a word for Jimmy Brown
        he ain't got nothin' at all
        Not the shirt right off his back
        he ain't got nothin' at all
        And say a word for Ginger Brown
        walks with his head down to the ground
        Took the shoes right off his feet
        they threw the poor boy right out in the street
        and this is what he said

        Oh, sweet nothin'
        she ain't got nothin' at all
        Oh, sweet nothin'
        she ain't got nothin' at all

        Say a word for Pearly Mae
        she can't tell the night from the day
        They threw her out in the street
        just like a cat she landed on her feet
        And say a word for Joana Love
        she ain't got nothin' at all
        With every day she falls in love
        and every night she falls
        and when she does, she says

        no he ain't got nothin' at all
        And say a word for Ginger
        he walks with his head to the ground
        They took shoes, took the shoes, from his feet, from his feet
        and threw the poor boy right out in the street
        and then, he said

        Oh, sweet, sweet nothin'
        she ain't got she ain't got, she ain't got nothin' at all

I saw you didn't have the lyrics for the early version of
"Oh! Sweet nuthin'" found on "Fully loaded edition".
So I've transcribed it for you,
although there was one thing I didn't hear.



Oh, sweet nothin', ooooh
Well, baby ain't got nothin' at all

Yeah, now, Jimmy Brown come walking
Says he ain't got nothin' at all
Yeah, put the shoes on down to the ground
But he ain't got nothin' at all

And everybody calls him

Oh, sweet nothin'
He ain't got nothin' at all, let me hear you now, now
Oh, sweet nothin'
Whoa, he ain't got nothin' at all

Now talk to me

Yeah, sweet Jimmy Brown
He walks with his head right down to the ground
And Pearly-May with the silver in her hair
You know, you're gonna see her everywhere

And when you do she gonna see you ****

Oh, sweet nothin'
Yeah, ain't nothin' at all, let me hear you now, now
Oh, sweet nothin'
Ain't babe nothin' at all, let me hear you now

Ooooh, sweet nothin'
Oh, she ain't got nothin' at all
Oh, sweet nothin'
You know, she ain't got nothin' at all


I think the chords are basically the same
as with the original version of the song.

Old Poe:

        If I could have the glorious moment
        The wondrous opportunity to comprehend
        The chance to see my younger self
        One time
        To converse
        To hear his thoughts

CDEP "Hooky Wooky"

written by Lou Reed

* a.k.a. "On The Run"

* outtake from _Set The Twilight Reeling_ sessions
* written for the play _Time Rocker_ (1996)
==================================================


        You don't ever compromise
        I see the pain in your eyes
        Don't you worry, the game is won
        I'll be there on the run

        I'll make you happy, the others are thick
        just call me up, I'll be your big stick
        They do it for money that's what they call fun
        I'll be there on the run

        A room with thirteen chairs
        three lions, ten polar bears
        An ice cube the size of the sun
        I'll be there on the run

        I see pain in your eyes
        and you know I sympathize
        I'll come runnin' the game is won
        I'll be there on the run

        We have never compromised
        I'll say I love you a million times
        Don't you forget it, the game is won
        I'll be there on the run

        Don't you forget it, the game is won
        I'll be there on the run

"RUN"

You've not ever compromised
I see the pain in your eyes
Don't you worry
The game is one
I'll be there on the run

I'll make you happy
The others are...
Just call me up...
...your big stick
They do it for money
That's what they call fun
I'll be there on the run
A room with thirteen chairs
Three lines ten...
An ice cube that...
I'll be there on the run
I see pain in your eyes
And you know I see it...

We've never compromised
I said i love you a million times
Don't you forget it
The game is one
I'll be there on the run.

On The Run


You don't ever compromise

Just call me up, I'll be your big stick

I'll come runnin', the game is won

Don't you forget it, the game is won
I'll be there on the run

"One Beautiful Evening"
==========================
album _Life On A String_
(Laurie Anderson, 2001)

written by Laurie Anderson

Lou Reed: guitar
==========================


        One beautiful evening
        in the Garden of Eden
        A snake came walking in the twilight
        He was leaning on his ivory cane
        And he said
        Let me tell you a little secret about life
        There's a certain sharpness
        to a knife
        or a diamond
        Come here
        Watch it glitter

        Oh, it's another blue day
        in a nowhere place

        We're singing hey-hey, nonny-nay
        I'm a little teapot
        short and stout
        Tip me over
        and pour me out

        You know when the Egyptians
        built their steam trains
        They didn't have any fuel to burn
        no wood, no trees anywhere
        But what they did have a lot of
        was old mummy rags
        lying around
        So they gathered up all the rages
        and they burned them in their trains
        Yeah, they burned their ancestors
        for fuel

        Ooohhh, I'm a crocodile
        floating down the river
        I'm a tree catching my own oranges
        as they fall from my head

        I'm a little teapot
        short and stout
        Tip me over
        and pour me out

        And hello to all the people who sent me on the way
        A pat on the back, have fun, it's your moment now
        It's your turn to walk along the runway road
        And me?
        I sent my better self on ahead
        Your attention, please

        It's like at the end of the play
        and all the actors come out
        and they line up and they look at you
        And horrible things have happened to them during the play
        and they stand there
        while you clap
        and now what?
        What happens next?
        And the fire dies
        and there were furious winds
        where we went

        We're singing hey-hey, nonny-nay
        We're singing hey-hey, nonny-nay
        It's another blue day
        in a nowhere place
        We're singing hey-hey, nonny-nay

        I'm a little teapot
        short and stout
        Tip me over
        and pour me out

        Oh beauty in all its forms
        funny how hatred can also be a beautiful thing
        When it's as sharp as a knife
        as hard as a diamond

        Perfect

"One For My Baby (And One More For The Road)"
=============================================
album _Duet_
(Rob Wasserman, 1988)

written by Harold Arlen/Johnny Mercer

Lou Reed: vocals, guitar
=============================================


        It's quarter to three, no one in the place
        except you and me
        So set 'em up bro, I've got a little story
        in my one know

        We're drinking my friend, to the end
        of a brief episode
        Make it one for my baby
        one more for the road

        I got this routine, put another quarter
        in the machine
        I'm feeling so bad, wish you make the music
        dreamin' and sad

        I tell you a lot, but you've got to be
        true do your code
        Make it one for my baby and -
        one more for the road

        I know you'd never know it, but men I'm a kind of poet
        and I've got a lot of things to you say
        But when I'm gloomy, it's best to listen to me
        until it's talked away

        That's how it goes, hey Joe, I know your gettin'
        ready to close
        Hey baby, thanks for the cheer, I hope you didn't mind me
        bending your ear

        This torch that I found, must be drowned
        or soon .......
        Make it one for my baby
        one more for the road
        One more for my baby
        one more for the road

        For the long (long-long, lonesome road)
        long-long road (long-long, lonesome road)
        For the long (long-long, lonesome road)

i saw the lyrics and then i listened to the song
and they're not the same so, i changed some of the wrong words.
things like " quarter" instead of "nickel".
well, it's not important, just a few little things.



(previous): So set 'em up Bro. I got a story
(update)  : So set 'em up Bro. I got a little story

(previous): I got the routine, put another nickel
(update)  :  I got the routine, put another quarter

"One World One Voice"
===========================
album _One World One Voice_
(Various Artists, 1990)

written by Lou Reed
===========================


        One world one voice
        speaking in a common tongue
        speaking with a common drum
        the drumming of your heart

        One world one voice
        speaking in a common tongue
        music speaks to everyone
        and everyone speaks to it

        One world one voice
        each of us has our own choice
        the choice whether to live or die
        the music makes you smile

        One world one voice
        our commonness gives us a choice
        and since we really all are one
        it's all or nothing at all

        One world one voice
        speaking in a common tongue
        speaking through guitars and drums
        making us all one

        One world one voice
        our commonness gives us a choice
        and since we really all are one
        it's all or nothing at all

        One world one voice

"Ooohhh Baby"
=========================
album _Coney Island Baby_
(Lou Reed, 1976)

written by Lou Reed
=========================


        You're the kind of girl
        that everybody's wondering about
        You're the kind of person
        that everybody's a-staring at
        But now you're a topless dancer
        working out of a bar on Times Spuare
        And everybody wishes you were back
        in the massage parlor back there on 9th Avenue
        (three-eleven) you make me go

        Ooohhh baby, ooohhh baby, ooohhh baby
        ooohhh ooohhh ooohhh
        Ooohhh baby, ooohhh baby, ooohhh baby
        ooohhh ooohhh ooohhh

        Your old man was the best B and E man
        down on the streets
        And all the guy on the precinct
        always was watching for him on their beat
        But when he ripped off Seymour
        he was really not a doing so fine
        And everything is not swelled except his hands and legs
        and maybe even mime
        he's feeling maybe it's good that they said

        Ooohhh baby, ooohhh baby, ooohhh
        ooohhh baby, ooohhh
        Ooohhh baby, ooohhh baby, ooohhh
        hey baby, ooohhh ooohhh ooohhh

        It's very funny asking me
        why they keep the lights on down so low
        Well yesterday's trade's today's competition
        or didn't you know
        And all florescent lighting makes it so your wrinkles
        they don't show
        And it's very funny the way your
        twenty bucks an hour can a go
        if you don't make me go now now now

        Ooohhh baby, ooohhh baby, ooohhh
        ooohhh baby, ooohhh
        Ooohhh baby, ooohhh baby, ooohhh baby
        ooohhh ooohhh ooohhh

        Everybody wondered 'bout you when you were seen
        in drinking some beer
        You got here from Ohio and your mother said
        you'd hook her and be real near
        that's the way it goes now

        Ooohhh baby, ooohhh baby, ooohhh baby
        ooohhh ooohhh ooohhh
        hey shake your buns now, mama
        Ooohhh baby, ooohhh baby, ah
        hey ooohhh baby, ooohhh
        walk it now

        (Ooohhh baby ooohhh, ooohhh baby ooohhh) Get down
        (ooohhh baby ooohhh, ooohhh baby ooohhh)

"Open House"
=============================
album _Songs For Drella_
(Lou Reed/John Cale, 1990)

written by Lou Reed/John Cale
=============================


        Please
        Come over to 81st street I'm in the apartment
        above the bar
        You know you can't miss it, it's across from the subway
        and the tacky store with the Mylar scarves
        My skin's as pale as outdoors moon
        my hair's silver like a Tiffany watch
        I like lots of people around me but don't kiss hello
        and please don't touch

        It's a Czechoslovakian custom my mother passed on to me
        the way to make friends Andy is invite them up for tea
        Open house
        open house

        I've got a lot of cats, here's my favorite
        she's a lady called Sam
        I made a paper doll of her, you can have it
        that's what I did when I had St. Vitus' dance

        It's a Czechoslovakian custom my mother passed on to me
        give people little presents so they'll remember me
        Open house
        open house

        Someone bring vegetables
        someone please bring heat
        My mother showed up yesterday
        we need something to eat

        I think I got a job today they want me to draw shoes
        the ones I drew were old and used they told me
        draw something new
        Open house
        open house

        Fly me to the moon
        fly me to a star
        But there're no stars in the New York sky
        they're all on the ground

        You scared yourself with music, I scared myself with paint
        I drew 550 different shoes today, it almost made me faint
        Open house
        open house
        Open house
        open house

        Oh no, not me baby
        what did I do to make you pick on me
        Oh no, what did I do, ah
        what did I say to make you come to me

        You could've said no
        a thousand times before
        You could've said less yes's
        and said more no's, but oh no

        Baby such a big shot, standing on a small spot
        why do opposites attract (opposites attract)
        Baby such a big shot, standing on a small spot
        why do opposites attract, (opposites attract) oh
        Baby such a big shot, standing on a small spot
        why do opposites attract, (woh, opposites attract) oh
        Baby such a big shot, standing on a small spot
        ooohhh

        But oh no, ah, here I go
        why did you do it, I'm in love again
        But oh no, not me baby
        why did we do it, I'm in love again

        You could've said no

        You could've said less yes's
        and said more no's, but oh no

        Baby such a big shot, standing on a small spot

        uncross your thighs and walk out the door girl

"The Original Wrapper"
======================
album _Mistrial_
(Lou Reed, 1986)

written by Lou Reed
======================


        I was sittin' home on the West End
        watchin' cable TV with a female friend
        we were watchin' the news, the world's in a mess
        the poor and the hungry, a world in distress
        Herpes, AIDS, the Middle East at full throttle
        better check that sausage before you put it in the waffle
        and while you're at it, check what's in the batter
        make sure the candy's in the original wrapper

        Hey pitcher, better check that batter
        make sure the candy's in the original wrapper

        Reagan says abortion's murder
        while he's looking at Cardinal O'Connor
        look at Jerry Falwell, Louis Farrakhan
        both talk religion and the brotherhood of man
        They both sound like they belong in Teheran
        watch out, they're going full throttle
        better watch that sausage before you put it in the waffle
        and while you're at it, better check that batter
        make sure the candy's in the original wrapper

        Hey pitcher, better check that batter
        make sure the candy's in the original wrapper

        White against white, Black against Jew
        it seems like it's 1942
        the baby sits in front of MTV
        watching violent fantasies
        While Dad guzzles beer with his favorite sport
        only to find his heroes are all coked up
        classic, original, the same old story
        the politics of hate in a new surrounding
        Hate if it's good and hate if it's bad
        and if this all don't make you mad
        I'll keep yours and I'll keep mine
        nothing sacred and nothing divine
        Father, bless me, we're going full throttle
        better check that sausage before you put it in the waffle
        and while you're at it, better check that batter
        make sure the candy's in the original wrapper

        Hey pitcher, better check that batter
        make sure the candy's in the original wrapper, hey hey

        I was born in the United States
        and I grew up hard but I grew up straight
        I saw a lack of morals and a lack of concern
        a feeling that there's nowhere to turn
        Yippies, Hippies and upwardly mobile Yuppies
        don't treat me like I'm some damn lackey
        'cause the murderer lives while the victims die
        I'd much rather see it an eye for an eye
        A heart for a heart, a brain for a brain
        and if this all makes you feel a little insane
        kick up your heels, turn the music up loud
        pick up your guitar and look out at the crowd, and say
        "Don't mean to come on sanctimonious
        but life's got me nervous and little pugnacious
        lugubrious so I give a salutation
        and rock on out to beat really fabulous
        Ohh poop ah doo and how do you do
        hip hop gonna bop till I drop"
        watch out world, comin' at you full throttle
        better check that sausage before you put it in the waffle
        and while you're at it, better check that batter
        make sure the candy's in the original wrapper

        Hey hey pitcher, better check that batter
        make sure the candy's in the original wrapper
        hey pitcher, better check that batter
        make sure the candy's in the original wrapper, hey hey hey

"Original Wrapper"
====================================
album _Perfect Night Live In London_
(Lou Reed, 1998)

Jul 03, 1997
Royal Festival Hall, London
(Meltdown Festival)
====================================


        Hey, original wrapper

        I was sittin' home on the West End
        watchin' cable TV with a TV friend
        we're watchin' the news and the world's in a mess
        the poor and the hungry, a world in distress
        Herpes, AIDS, the Middle East at full throttle
        better check that sausage before you put it in the waffle
        and while you're at it, check what's in the batter
        make sure the candy's in the original wrapper

        Hey pitcher, better check that batter
        make sure the candy's in the original wrapper
        hey pitcher, better check that batter
        make batter, ah, original wrapper

        White against white, Black against Jew
        it seems like it's 1942
        baby sits in front of MTV
        well watching violent fantasies
        While Dad guzzles beer with his favorite sport
        then to find his heroes are all coked up
        fantastic, original, the same old story
        politics of hate in a new surrounding
        Hate if it's good, hate if it's bad
        wow wow woh, don't make you mad
        I'll keep yours and I'll keep mine
        there's nothing sacred and nothing divine
        Hey father, hit me, we're going full throttle
        check that sausage before you put it in the waffle and
        while you're at it, hey, while you're at it
        hey, while you're at it, make sure the batter
        Make sure the candy's
        you know original wrapper, go Michael, go

        I was born in the United States
        I grew up hard but I grew up straight
        saw a lack of morals and a lack of concern
        a feeling that there's nowhere to turn
        Yippies, Hippies and upwardly mobile Yuppies
        don't treat me like I'm some damn lackey
        'cause the murderer lives while the victims die
        I'd much rather see it an eye for an eye
        Heart for heart and brain for brain
        if this all makes you feel a little insane
        kick up your heels, turn the music up loud
        pick up your guitar and look out at the crowd, and say
        "Don't mean to come on sanctimonious
        but life's got me nervous and little pugnacious
        Lugubrious so I give a salutation
        and rock on out to beat really stupid
        Ohh poop ah doo and how do you do
        gonna hip hop, bop gonna till I drop"

        Hey pitcher, in your batter
        make sure the candy's in the original wrapper

        Hey pitcher, better check that batter
        make sure the candy's in the original wrapper

        Hey now pitcher, better check that batter
        make sure the candy's in the original wrapper

album _Mistrial_
(Lou Reed, 1986)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        Outside the world's a mindless child
        outside
        Outside reflects the worst of styles
        outside
        Inside when you're in my arms
        a mindless child is still to be born
        Inside, baby, when we come inside
        ah

        Outside the politics of greed
        outside
        Outside misbehavior seethes
        outside
        Mindless repression dominates the street
        while I kneel down and kiss your feet
        Inside, baby, when we come inside
        outside

        Outside they don't think they breed
        outside
        Outside emotion determines need
        outside
        Outside the world's a mindless child
        that we could bring to life in your arms
        Inside, baby, when we come inside

        Outside the world's a mindless child

        it's a mindless child that you want

"Outside"

Outside the world's a mindless child Outside
Outside reflects the worst of styles Outside
Inside when you're in my arms
A mindless child is still to be borne
Inside, Baby, when we come Inside

Outside the politics of greed Outside

While I kneel down and kiss your feet

(The Velvet Underground, 1974)

written by Lou Reed

Nov 1969
San Francisco, California
==================================================


        Here I go again
        just gonna play it like a fool again
        Here I go again
        over you
        Over you

        I'm just like a bell again
        you know I'm starting to ring again
        Here I go again
        over you
        Over you

        Oh, here I go again
        you know I'm feeling really silly again
        Ah, I'm on my feet again
        over you
        Over you

        Oh, I'm on my feet again
        you know that I'm like a bell that rings
        I'm feelin' so fine again
        over you
        Over you

        Typically when I had it
        I treated it like dirt
        Naturally now, I want it
        I keep chasin' yesterday's rainbows

        Oh, here I go again
        you know I'm feeling real silly again
        Oh, I'm like a mad fool again
        over you
        Over you

        Oh, I'm like a bell that rings
        I'm like a flower that waits to spring
        Oh I, here I'm goin' again

        over you
        Over you

I believe you've got the lyrics to the Quine Tapes version of
"Over You" wrong.
I hear these ones quite clearly on the recording:


         Oh, here I go again
         you know I'm feeling really silly again
         Ah, I'm on my feet again
         Over you
         Over you

         Oh, I'm on my feet again
         you know that I'm like a bell that rings
         I'm feelin' so fine again
         Over you
         Over you

         Typically when I had it
         I treated it like dirt
         Naturally now, I want it
         I keep chasin' yesterday's rainbows

         Oh, here I go again
         You know I'm feeling real silly again
         Oh, I'm like a mad fool again
         Over you
         Over you

         Oh, I'm like a bell that rings
         I'm like a flower that waits to spring
         Oh I, here I'm goin' again
         Oh, over you
         Over you
         Over you
         Over you

"Pale Blue Eyes"
==============================
album _The Velvet Underground_
(The Velvet Underground, 1969)

written by Lou Reed
==============================


        Sometimes I feel so happy
        sometimes I feel so sad
        Sometimes I feel so happy
        but mostly you just make me mad
        Baby, you just make me mad

        Linger on your pale blue eyes
        Linger on your pale blue eyes

        Thought of you as my mountain top
        thought of you as my peak
        Thought of you as everything
        I've had but couldn't keep
        I've had but couldn't keep

        Linger on your pale blue eyes
        Linger on your pale blue eyes

        If I could make the world as pure
        and strange as what I see
        I'd put you in a mirror
        I put in front of me
        I put in front of me

        Linger on your pale blue eyes
        Linger on your pale blue eyes

        Skip a life completely
        stuff it in a cup
        She said money is like us in time
        it lies but can't stand up
        Down for you is up

        Linger on your pale blue eyes
        Linger on your pale blue eyes

        It was good what we did yesterday
        and I'd do it once again
        The fact that you are married
        only proves you're my best friend
        But it's truly, truly a sin

        Linger on your pale blue eyes
        Linger on your pale blue eyes

Max's Kansas City, NYC
=================================


        Sometimes I feel so happy
        sometimes I feel so sad
        You know sometimes I feel so happy
        ah, but mostly, baby, you just make me mad
        Honey, you just make me mad

        Linger on your pale blue eyes
        Linger on your pale blue eyes

        You know I thought of you as my mountain top
        I even thought of you as my peak
        I thought of you as just 'bout everything
        you know that I've had in this sad life
        but I couldn't keep
        That I've had and I just couldn't keep

        Linger on your pale blue eyes
        Linger on your pale blue eyes

        You know if I could make the world as pure
        and strange as what I see
        I'd put you in a mirror
        that I put right in front of me
        That I put right in front of me

        Linger on your pale blue eyes
        Linger on your pale blue eyes
        this is what she said

        Skip a life completely
        stuff it in a cup
        She said you know you and me
        we're just like money in time
        you know how you lie and can't stand up
        She said to me down for you is up

        Linger on your pale blue eyes
        Linger on your pale blue eyes

        Oh, it was good what we did yesterday
        I'd surely do it again
        And the fact that you're married
        I suppose that only proves that you're my best friend
        Well I'll tell you something, it's truly, truly a sin

        Linger on your pale blue eyes
        Linger on, girl, your pale blue eyes

        and you know I'd do it again
        The fact that you are married
        only proves you're my best friend, oh oh oh oh
        But it's truly, truly a sin

"Pale Blue Eyes"

unreleased live
(The Velvet Underground, 1968)

* different lyrics

Oct 02, 1968
La Cave, Cleveland, Ohio
==============================


        I thought of you as my mountain top
        I thought of you as my peak
        I thought of you as everything
        I've had but couldn't keep
        I've had but couldn't keep

        Linger on your pale blue eyes
        Linger on your pale blue eyes

        Sister Jenny went down to Mexico
        took five trips around the world
        She came back and she's all shot full of hole
        she's such a funny kind of girl
        She's such a funny kind of girl

        Linger on your pale blue eyes
        Linger on your pale blue eyes

        Up the stairway and out the back
        hey baby, won't you please come home
        Been out in the graveyard since half past six
        yeah me, I'd never had no home
        I'd never had no home

        Linger on your pale blue eyes
        Linger on your pale blue eyes

        Back on the south, go and get out on the street again
        had my partner right by my side
        The meanest damn band in all the land
        and I guess that I'll see you in the by and by
        I'll see you all in the good old by and by

        Linger on your pale blue eyes
        Linger on your pale blue eyes

        Ah, here comes Miss Sally, she's mad .........
        here, three, four more times
        she comes ....... the same thing twice
        They put her upside down and held her upon the church
        then they froze her into a piece of ice
        That's cause she did not ask herself too nice

        Linger on your pale blue eyes
        Linger on your pale blue eyes

        The angels went to heaven and then the devil went to hell
        and I see her comin' down from the ceiling in my room
        You look like the mad monk who came here from Afghanistan
        you should've seen the mother when he came down in his room
        I certainly couldn't get out of there too soon

        Linger on your pale blue eyes
        Linger on your pale blue eyes

Here's the lyrics for the live version of "Pale blue eyes"
from the "Live at Max's Kansas city" album:



Sometimes I feel so happy
Sometimes I feel so sad
You know, sometimes I feel so happy
Ah, but mostly baby you just make me mad
Honey, you just make me mad

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

You know, I thought of you as my mountaintop
I even thought of you as my peak
I thought of you as just about everything
You know, that I've had in this sad life, but I couldn't keep
That I've had and I just couldn't keep

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

You know, if I could make the world as pure
And strange as what I see
I'll put you in the mirror
That I put right in front of me
That I put right in front of me

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

This is what she said

Skip the life completely
Stuff it in a cup
She said: "You know, you and me we're just like money in time
You know, how you lie and you can't stand up"
She said to me "Down for you is up"

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

Oh, it was good what we did yesterday
I'd surely do it again
And the fact that your married
I suppose that only proves that you're my best friend
Well, I'll tell you something: It's truly, truly a sin

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on, girl, your pale blue eyes

"Paranoia Key Of E"
===================
album _Ecstasy_
(Lou Reed, 2000)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        How come you say you will and then you won't
        you change your mind and then you say you don't
        The mystery is why I play the goat
        the mystery you call love

        Sometimes you're like an eagle strong like a rock
        other times it seems you get unlocked
        And all your worst fears come tumbling out
        into the street, into the snow

        I remember when you had a dream
        everything was what it seemed to be
        But now nightmares replace everything
        and everything you see is wrong

        You said we'd meet but you're two hours late
        you said you thought someone had picked your gate
        So you hid and were afraid to wait
        seeing shadows in the snow
        Seeing shadows in the snow

        Now your friend Godfrey is a perfect choice
        one minute down next time rejoice, he seems -
        - To have found the perfect voice
        paranoia key of E

        Let's say everything he says is true
        you love me but I cheat on you
        And in my bedroom is a female zoo
        worse then Clinton in prime time

        I swear to you I'm not with Jill or Joyce
        or Cyd or Sherry or Darlene or worse
        I'm not kissing you while inside I curse
        paranoia key of E

        Let's play a game the next time we meet, ah
        I'll be the hands and you be the feet
        And together we will keep the beat
        to paranoia key of E

        Now you know mania's in the key of B
        psychosis in the key of C
        Let's hope that we're not meant to be
        in paranoia key of E

        Anorexia is in G flat
        and F is anything I've left out
        Dyslexia, kleptomania and vertigo
        patricide A, matricide D the same schizos

        Paranoia key of E

        Let's have a coda in the key of K
        something that only we can play
        Maybe we'll light up like a hundred K
        paranoia out of key

        Paranoia key of E
        paranoia key of E

        Anorexia, dyslexia
        kleptomania, patricide A, matricide D, vertigo, schizos

        Paranoia key of E, paranoia
        paranoia, paranoia, paranoia key of E
        Paranoia, paranoia, paranoia key of E

They are the exact words he sings,
not just lyrics I copied from the booklet.



Paranoia key of E
------------------

How come you say you will and then you won't
You change your mind and then you say you don't
The mystery is why I play the goat
The mystery you call love

Sometimes you're like an eagle strong like a rock
Other times it seems you get unlocked
and all your worst fears come tumbling out
into the street into the snow

I remember when you had a dream
Everything was what it seemed to be
But now nightmares replace everything
and everything you see is wrong

You said we'd meet but you're 2 hours late
You said you thought someone had picked your gate
so you hid and were afraid to wait
seeing shadows in the snow
seeing shadows in the snow

Now your friend Godfrey is a perfect choice
One minute down next time rejoice
He seems to have found the perfect voice
Paranoia key of E

Let's say everything he says is true
You love me but I cheat on you
and in my bedroom is a female zoo
worse then Clinton in prime time
I swear to you I'm not with Jill or Joyce
or Cyd or Sherry or Darlene or worse
I'm not kissing you while inside I curse
Paranoia key of E

Let's play a game the next time we meet
I'll be the hands and you be the feet
and together we will keep the beat
to paranoia key of E

Now I know mania's in the key of B
Psychosis in the key of C
Let's hope that we're not meant to be
in paranoia key of E

Anorexia is in G flat
and F is anything I've left out
dyslexia, kleptomania and vertigo
patricide A and matricide D the same schizos
Paranoia key of E

Let's have a coda in the key of K
Something that only we can play
Maybe we'll light up like a 100K
Paranoia out of key
Paranoia key of E
Paranoia key of E

Anorexia, dyslexia
kleptomania, patricide a, matricide D,
vertigo, schizos
Paranoia key of E
Paranoia, paranoia, paranoia, paranoia key of E
Paranoia, paranoia, paranoia key of E

"Passengers"
=====================================
album _Recitement_
(Stephen Emmer, 2008)

written by Paul Therouh/Stephen Emmer

Lou Reed: voice
=====================================


        Ever since childhood
        when I lived within earshot of the Boston and Maine
        I have seldom heard a train go by and not wished
        I was on it
        Those whistles sing bewitchment
        railways are irresistible bazaars
        snaking along perfectly level no matter what the landscape
        improving your mood with speed
        and never upsetting your drink
        If a train is large and comfortable
        you don't even need a destination
        But I had chosen Asia

        Anything is possible on a train
        a good meal
        a binge
        a visit from cardplayers
        an intrigue
        a good night's sleep
        and strangers' monologues framed like Russian short stories
        It was my intension to board every train
        that chugged into view from Victoria Station in London
        to Tokyo Central
        to take the branch line to Simla
        the spur through the Khyber Pass and the chord line
        that links Indian Railways with those in Ceylon
        the Mandalay Express
        the Malaysian Golden Arrow
        the locals in Vietnam
        and the trains with bewitching names
        the Orient Express
        the North Star
        the Trans-Siberian
        I sought trains
        I found passengers

album _A Date With The Smithereens_

written by Jim Babjak

Lou Reed: guitar solos
===================================


        Listening to the sound of my heartbeat, yeah
        waiting for the silence to end
        While we're saying goodbye (saying goodbye)

        Even then delusions just filled my head
        when you said you need a friend
        I was there by your side (there by your side)

        Guess I'm wrong again this time
        'Cause when I see you girl I cry

        Yes we're going, goin' nowhere
        here's a lesson that I should have learned
        Now I'm running, runnin' nowhere
        past the point of no return

        Sitting in the darkness of my room, yeah
        making sure the pictures of you
        Have been placed out of sight (placed out of sight)

        Nothing seems the same in this empty bed
        waking up to see you're not there
        I can't sleep through the night (sleep through the night)

        Guess I'm wrong again this time
        'Cause when I see you girl I cry

        Yeah we're going, goin' nowhere
        here's a lesson that I should have learned
        Now I'm running, runnin' nowhere
        past the point of no return

        Yeah we're going, goin' nowhere
        there's a memory that I should burn
        Now I'm running, runnin' nowhere
        past the point of no return

        No return
        (point of no return)
        No return, no return

"Pow Wow"
========================
album _Legendary Hearts_
(Lou Reed, 1983)

written by Lou Reed
========================


        Christopher Columbus discovered America
        found he had a cornucopia
        Gave love to the Indians and they gave it back
        a pow wow in the teepee is where it's at

        I want to dance with you
        I want to dance with you
        I want to dance with you
        I want to dance with you

        The Indian fought with his arrow and his bow
        till General Custer lost to Sitting Bull
        Scalped all day and scalped all night
        give me that fire water, I'm gonna buy me a wife

        I want to dance with you
        I want to dance with you
        I want to dance with you
        I want to dance with you

        When your people first moved to our block
        our ancestors met with culture shock
        Two different monkeys from two different trees
        come on let's stop our fightin' and come dance with me

        Come on and dance with me
        come on and dance with me
        'Cause I really want to dance with you
        I want to dance with you
        come on and dance with me

"Power And Glory - The Situation"
=================================
album _Magic And Loss_
(Lou Reed, 1992)

written by Lou Reed/Mike Rathke
=================================


        I was visited by the power and the glory
        I was visited by a majestic hymn
        Great bolts of lightning lighting up the sky
        electricity flowing through my veins

        I was captured by a larger moment
        I was seized by divinity's hot breath
        Gorged like a lion on experience
        powerful from life

        (I wanted all of it, all of it, all of it)
        All of it
        (Not just some of it, all of it, all of it)
        All of it

        I saw a man turn into a bird
        I saw a bird turn into a tiger
        I saw a man hang from a cliff by the tips of his toes
        in the jungles of the Amazon

        I saw a man put a redhot needle through his eye
        turn into a crow and fly through the trees
        Swallow hot coals and breathe out flames
        and I wanted this to happen to me

        (I wanted all of it, all of it, all of it)
        All of it
        (All of it, all of it, all of it)
        Not some of it

        We saw the moon vanish into his pocket
        we saw the stars disappear from sight
        We saw him walk across water into the sun
        while bathed in eternal light

        We spewed out questions waiting for answers
        creating legends, religions and myths
        Books, stories, movies and plays
        all trying to explain this

        (I wanted all of it, oh, all of it)
        All of it
        (All of it, oh, all of it)
        Not some of it

        I saw a great man turn into a little child
        the cancer reduce him to dust
        His voice growing weak as he fought for his life
        with a bravery few men know

        I saw isotopes introduced into his lungs
        trying to stop the cancerous spread
        And it made me think of "Leda And The Swan"
        and gold being made from lead

        The same power that burned Hiroshima
        causing three legged babies and death
        Shrunk to the size of a nickel
        to help him regain his breath

        And I was struck by the power and the glory
        I was visited by a majestic Him
        Great bolts of lightning lighting up the sky
        as the radiation flowed through him

        (I wanted all of it, not just some of it, all of it)
        He wanted all of it
        (All of it, all of it, all of it)
        He wanted all of it, not some of it

"Power And Glory Part II - Magic Transformation"
================================================
album _Magic And Loss_
(Lou Reed, 1992)

written by Lou Reed/Mike Rathke
================================================


        I was visited by the power and the glory
        I was visited by a majestic hymn
        Great bolts of lightning lighting up the sky
        electricity flowing through my veins

        I was captured by a larger moment
        I was seized by divinity's hot breath
        Gorged like a lion on experience
        powerful from life

        I wanted all of it, all of it
        all of it, not some of it
        All of it, all of it
        not just some of it, but all of it

        I saw a man turn into a bird
        I saw a bird turn into a tiger
        I saw a man hang from a cliff by the tips of his toes
        in the jungles of the Amazon

        I saw a man put a redhot needle through his eye
        turn into a crow and fly through the trees
        Swallow hot coals and breathe out flames
        and I wanted this to happen to me
        oh, I wanted this to happen to me

        I wanted all of it, all of it
        all of it, not some of it
        All of it, all of it
        not just some of it, but all of it

        cancer reduce him to dust

        We saw the moon vanish into his pocket
        we saw the stars disappear from sight
        We saw him walk across water into the sun
        while bathed in eternal light

        We spewed out questions waiting for answers
        creating legends, religions and myths
        Books, stories, movies and plays
        all trying to explain this

        I wanted all of it, all of it
        all of it, not some of it
        All of it, all of it
        not just some of it, but all of it

        I saw a great man turn into a little child
        the cancer reduce him to dust
        His voice growing weak as he fought for his life
        with a bravery stronger than lust

        I saw isotopes introduced into his lungs
        trying to stop the cancerous spread
        And it made me think of "Leda And The Swan"
        and gold being made from lead

        The same power that burned Hiroshima
        causing three legged babies and death
        Shrunk to the size of a nickel
        to help him regain his breath

        And I was struck by the power and the glory
        and I was visited by a majestic Him
        Great bolts of lightning shooting up his veins
        as the radiation flowed through him

        He wanted all of it, all of it
        all of it, not just some of it
        All of it, all of it
        not some of it, but all of it

"The Power Of Positive Drinking"
===================================
album _Growing Up In Public_
(Lou Reed, 1980)

written by Lou Reed/Michael Fonfara
===================================


        Some like wine and some like hops
        but what I really love is my scotch
        It's the power, the power of positive drinking

        Some people ruin their drinks with ice
        and then they, they ask you for advice
        They tell you, I've never told anyone else before

        They say, Candy is dandy but liquor makes quipsters
        and I don't like mixers, or sippers or sob sisters
        You know, you have to be real careful where you sit down
        in a bar these days

        And then some people drink to unleash their libidos
        and other people drink to prop up their egos
        It's my burdon, man, people say
        I have the kind of face you can trust

        The pow-pow-pow-pow-power of positive drinking
        The pow-pow-pow-pow-power of positive
        The pow-pow-pow-pow-power of positive
        the pow-pow-pow-pow-power of positive
        the pow-pow-pow-pow-power of positive drinking

        Some people say, alcohol makes you less lucid
        and think that's true if you're kind of stupid
        I'm not that kind that get's himself burned twice

        And some say liquor kills the cells in your head
        and for that matter so does getting out of bed
        When I exit, I'll go out gracefully, shot in my hand

        The pow-pow-pow-pow-power of positive drinking
        The pow-pow-pow-pow-power of positive
        The pow-pow-pow-pow-power of positive
        the pow-pow-pow-pow-power of positive
        the pow-pow-pow-pow-power of positive drinking

The Power Of Positive Drinking

Some like wine and some like hops
But what I really love is my scotch
It's the power of positive drinking

Some people ruin their drinks with ice
Anmd then they, they ask you for advice
They tell you, "I've never told anyone this before"

They say, "Candy is dandy but liquor makes quipsters."
And  I don't like mixers, or sippers or sob sisters,
You know, you have to be real careful
where you sit down in a bar these days

The pow pow pow pow power of positive drinking
The pow pow pow pow power of positive drinking
The pow pow pow pow power of positive drinking
The pow pow pow pow power of positive drinking
The pow pow pow pow power of positive drinking

And then some people drink to unleash their libidos
And other people drink to prop up their egos
It's my burdon, man, people say I
Have the kind of face you can trust

Some people say, alcohol makes you less lucid
And think that's true if you're kind of stupid
I'm not that kind that get's himself burned twice

And some say liquor kills the cells in your head
And for that matter so does getting out of bed
When I exit, I'll go out gracefully, shot in my hand

The pow pow pow pow power of positive drinking
The pow pow pow pow power of positive drinking
The pow pow pow pow power of positive drinking
The pow pow pow pow power of positive drinking
The pow pow pow pow power of positive drinking

"The Power Of The Heart"
============================
_Cartier Love_ (audio files)
(Various Artists, 2008)

written by Lou Reed
============================


        You and me we always sweat and strain
        you look for sun, I look for rain
        We're different people, we're not the same
        the power of the sun

        I looked at treetops, you looked for caps
        above the water, where the waves snap back
        I flew around the world to bring you back
        ah, the power of the heart

        You looked at me and I looked at you
        the sleeping heart was shining through
        The wispy cobwebs that we're breathing through
        the power of the heart

        I looked at you and you looked at me
        I thought of the past, you thought of what could be
        I asked you once again to marry me
        ooohhh, the power of the heart

        Everybody says love makes the world go round
        I hear a bubbling, I hear a sound
        Of my heart beating and I turn around
        and find you standing at the door

        You know me I like to dream a lot
        of this and that and what is not
        And finally I figured out what was what
        it was the power of the heart
        The power of the heart

        You and me we sweat and strain
        ah, the result is always the same
        You think somehow we're in a game
        the power of the heart

        I think I'm dumb, I know you're smart
        the beating of a purebred heart
        I say this to you and it's not a lark
        marry me today

        You know me I like to dream a lot
        of what there is and what there's not
        But mainly I dream of you a lot
        the power of your heart
        The power of your heart

"Prologue (Ligiea)"
===================
album _The Raven_
(Lou Reed, 2003)

written by Lou Reed
===================



Young Poe:

        In the science of the mind
        there is no point
        more thrilling than to notice
        which I never noticed in schools
        that in our endeavors
        to recall to memory something long-forgotten
        we often find ourselves upon the very verge of remembrance
        without being in the end
        able to remember

        Under the intense scrutiny of Ligeia's eyes
        I have felt the full knowledge
        and force of their expression
        and yet been unable to possess it
        and have felt it leave me as so many other things have left
        the letter half-read, the bottle half-drunk
        finding in the commonest objects
        of the universe a circle of analogies
        of metaphors for that expression
        which has been willfully withheld from me
        the access to the inner soul denied

        Eyes blazed with a too-glorious effulgence
        pale fingers transparent, waxen, the hue of the grave
        Blue veins upon the lofty forehead swelled
        and sunk impetuously with the tides of deep emotion
        and I saw that she must die
        that she was wresting with the dark shadow
        Her stern nature had impressed me
        with the belief that, to her
        death would come without its terrors
        but not so
        I groaned in anguish at the pitiable spectacle
        I would have soothed
        I would have reasoned
        But she was amid the most convulsive of writhings
        Oh, pitiful soul
        Her voice more gentle
        more low, and yet her words grew wilder of meaning
        I reeled, entranced, to a melody more than mortal

        She loved me, no doubt
        and in her bosom
        love reigned as no ordinary passion
        But in death only was I impressed
        with the intensity of her affection
        Her more than passionate devotion amounted to idolatry
        How had I deserved to be so blessed
        and then cursed with the removal of my beloved
        upon the hour of her most delirious musings

        In her more than womanly abandonment to a love
        all unmerited and unworthily bestowed
        I came to realize the principle of her longing
        It was a yearning for life
        an eager, intense desire for life
        which was now fleeing so rapidly away
        as she returned solemnly to her bed of death
        And I had no utterance capable of expressing it
        except to say
        Man doth not yield to the angels
        nor unto death utterly
        save only through the weakness of his feeble will

        I became wild with the excitement
        of an immoderate does of opium
        I saw her raising wine to her lips
        or may have dreamed that I saw fall within a goblet
        as if from some invisible spring
        in the atmosphere of the room
        three of four large drops
        of a brilliant and ruby-colored fluid
        Falling
        While Ligeia lay in her bed of ebony
        the bed of death
        with mine eyes riveted upon her body
        Then came a moan
        a sob low and gentle but once
        I listened in superstitious terror but heard it not again
        I strained vision to see any motion in the corpse
        but here was not the slightest perceptible
        Yet I had heard the noise
        and my whole soul was awakened within me
        The red liquid fell and I thought, Ligeia lives
        and I felt my brain reel
        my heart cease to beat
        and my limbs go rigid where I sat
        In extremity of horror
        I heard a vague sound issuing from the region of the bed
        Rushing to her I saw
        I distinctly saw
        a tremor upon her lips
        I sprang to my feet and chafed
        and bathed the temples and hands but in vain
        all color fled
        all pulsation ceased
        Her lips resumed the expression of the dead
        the icy hue, the sunken outline
        and all the loathsome peculiarities of that
        which for many days has been the tenant of the tomb

        And again I sank into visions of Ligeia
        And again I heard a low sob
        As I looked she seemed to grow taller
        What inexpressible madness seized me with that thought?
        I ran to touch her
        Her head fell, and her clothing crumbled
        and there streamed forth huge masses of long disheveled hair
        It was blacker
        than the raven wings of midnight

"Prominent Men"
(demo)
===============================
box set _Peel Slowly And See_
(The Velvet Underground, 1995)

written by Lou Reed/John Cale

Jul 1965
John Cale's Ludlow Street loft,
lower Manhattan, NYC
===============================


        Through all of the highways, the byways I've travelled
        through all of the sidestreets and alleys of sin
        Through all that's been heard nothing sinks quite as low
        as the prominent statements of prominent men

        Prominent men tell prominent stories
        prominent men tell prominent lies
        Prominent men kiss the ass of Dame Fortune
        prominent men will tear out your eyes

        The streets that have life with the cat's underbelly
        aligned with their tracks of a thousand good-byes
        A poor woman screams with the heat of disaster
        as the prominent men sit and strengthen their ties

        Oh, the prominent girls of the prominent people
        make prominent dresses and prominent hair
        Oh, their prominent wealth and their eyes blazed with shadow
        the prominent horrors with the ghost millionaire

        The shiny stained window now cracked at sunset
        they shiny red dawn of the heart soon must fall
        This simply occurred at the seat of the cauldron
        those prominent men hadn't been there at all

        Prominent men tell prominent stories
        prominent men tell prominent lies
        Prominent men kiss the ass of Dame Fortune
        prominent men will tear out your eyes

        Oh, the prominent child of these prominent people
        seeks prominent schools with the finery of age
        With a prominent pink of a tasteless red orchid
        the prominent men casts a prominent heir

        The child of the agent walks barefoot upon grass
        he screams with a power that terror's green eyes
        His knife harshly glistening, stabs noways and always
        but those prominent men in nowhere in sight

        Prominent men tell prominent stories
        prominent men tell prominent lies
        Prominent men kiss the ass of Dame Fortune
        prominent men will tear out your eyes

Prominent Men off of Peel Slowly and See are actually as follows:


        Through all of the highways and byways I've travelled,
        Through all of the sidestreets and alleys of sin
        Through all that's been heard nothing sinks quite as low
        As the prominent statements of prominent men

        Prominent men tell prominent stories
        Prominent men tell prominent lies
        Prominent men kiss the ass of Dame Fortune
        Prominent men will tear out your eyes

        The streets that have life with the cat's underbelly
        Aligned with their tracks of a thousand good-byes
        A poor woman screams with the heat of disaster
        As the prominent men sit and strengthen their ties

        Oh the prominent girls of the prominent people
        Make prominent dresses and prominent hair
        Oh their prominent wealth and their eyes blazed with shadow
        The prominent horrors with the ghost millionaires

        The shiny stained windows now crackle at sunset
        They shiny red dawn of the heart soon must fall
        This (simply occurred at the seat?) of the cauldron
        Those prominent men hadn't been there at all

        Prominent men tell prominent stories
        Prominent men tell prominent lies
        Prominent men kiss the ass of Dame Fortune
        Prominent men will tear out your eyes

        Oh the prominent child of these prominent people
        Seeks prominent schools with the finery of age
        With a prominent pink of a tasteless red orchid
        The prominent men cast a prominent heir

        The child of the agent walks barefoot upon grass
        He screams with a power of terror's green eye
        His knife harshly glistening
        Stabs noways and always
        But those prominent men in nowhere in sight

        Prominent men tell prominent stories
        Prominent men tell prominent lies
        Prominent men kiss the ass of Dame Fortune
        Prominent men will tear out your eyes

"The Proposition"
================================
album _Set The Twilight Reeling_
(Lou Reed, 1996)

written by Lou Reed
================================


        You can't have the flower without the root
        you can't have the fire without the soot
        even a stripper needs her red tasseled suit
        and we were meant to be

        In every war the north needs the south
        and everyone knows all assholes have a mouth
        without mystery what would writers talk about
        we were meant to be

        An apple needs pits the way melons need seed
        your foot needs your arm and your arm needs your knee
        and one of these days I know you will need me
        we were meant to be, mmmm..
        we were meant to be

        You're mother's an ogre, your father's a scamp
        you won't see my parents honored on any stamp
        but just like a bulb screws into a lamp
        we were meant to be

        The way AIDS needs a vaccine, somewhere a vaccine needs AIDS
        the way a victim needs life, a life needs to be saved
        and out of all of this will come a better way
        we were meant to be

        So you can go to Europe, Los Angeles or Mars
        you can stand on a building throwing cinder-blocks at cars
        you can practice deep voodoo, but like me you'll see
        we were meant to be, mmmm..
        we were meant to be

        We were meant to be, mmmm..
        we were meant to be, mmmm..
        We were meant to be, mmmm..
        we were meant to be, mmmm..
        We were meant to be
        we were meant to be, mmmm..
        We were meant to be, mmmm..
        we were meant to be, mmmm..

====================================


        Well I'm up on the eleventh floor
        and I'm watching the cruisers below
        .... my heart's in the basement
        my weekend's at an all time low
        He's down on the street
        and he's tryin' hard to pull sister Flo
        'Cause she's hoping to score
        I can't see her letting him go
        Walk out of her heart
        walk out of her mind

        She's so swishy in her satin and tat
        in her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
        Oh God, I could do better than that

        She's an old time ambassador
        sweet talking, night walking games
        And she's known in the darkest clubs
        pushing ahead of the dames
        If she says she can do it, she can do it
        she don't make false claims
        But she's a queen, such are queens
        that your laughter is sucked in their brains
        now she's leading him on
        and she'll lay him right down
        Yes, she's leading him on
        and she'll lay him right down
        but it could have been me
        yes, it could have been me
        Didn't I say
        why didn't I say, hey

        She's so swishy in her satin and tat
        in her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
        Oh God, I could do better than that

        So I lay down a while
        and I dizzy at my hotel wall
        Oh, the cot is so cold
        I can't tell ....... it's no bed at all
        Yeah, I lay down a while
        and I stand, stand, stand ..... the wall
        And he's down on the street
        so I throw both his bags down the hall
        and I'm phoning a cab
        'cause my stomach feels small
        There's a taste in my mouth
        and it's no taste at all
        it could have been me
        yeah, it could have been me
        Why didn't I say
        why didn't I say

        She's so swishy in her satin and tat
        in her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
        Oh God, I could do better than that

"The Raven"
===================
album _The Raven_
(Lou Reed, 2003)

written by Lou Reed
===================



Poe:

        Once upon a midnight dreary
        as I pondered, weak and weary
        over many a quaint and curious
        volume of forgotten lore
        while I nodded, nearly napping
        suddenly there came a tapping
        as of some one gently rapping
        rapping at my chamber door
        "'Tis some visitor," I muttered
        "tapping at my chamber door
        only this and nothing more."

        Muttering I got up weakly
        always I've had trouble sleeping
        stumbling upright my mind racing
        furtive thoughts flowing once more
        I, there hoping for some sunrise
        happiness would be a surprise
        loneliness no longer a prize
        rapping at my chamber door
        seeking out the clever bore
        lost in dreams forever more
        only this and nothing more

        Hovering my pulse was racing
        stale tobacco my lips tasting
        scotch sitting upon my basin
        remnants of the night before
        came again
        infernal tapping on the door
        in my mind jabbing
        is it in or outside rapping
        calling out to me once more
        the fit and fury of Lenore
        nameless here forever more

        And the silken sad uncertain
        rustling of the purple curtain
        thrilled me, filled me
        with fantastic terrors never felt before
        so that now, oh wind, stood breathing
        hoping yet to calm my breathing
        "'Tis some visitor entreating
        entrance at my chamber door
        some lost visitor entreating
        entrance at my chamber door
        this it is, and nothing more."

        Deep into the darkness peering
        long I stood there
        wondering fearing
        doubting dreaming fantasies
        no mortal dared to dream before
        but the silence was unbroken
        and the stillness gave no token
        and the only word there spoken
        was the whispered name, "Lenore."
        this I thought
        and out loud whispered from my lips
        the foul name festered
        echoing itself
        merely this, and nothing more

        Back into my chamber turning
        every nerve within me burning
        when once again I heard a tapping
        somewhat louder than before
        "surely," said I
        surely that is something at my iron staircase
        open the door to see what threat is
        open the window, free the shutters
        let us this mystery explore
        oh, bursting heart be still this once
        and let this mystery explore
        it is the wind and nothing more

        Just one epithet I muttered as inside
        I gagged and shuddered
        when with manly flirt and flutter
        in there flew a stately raven
        sleek and ravenous as any foe
        not the least obeisance made he
        not a minutes gesture towards me
        of recognition or politeness
        but perched above my chamber door
        this fowl and salivating visage
        insinuating with its knowledge
        perched above my chamber door
        silent sat and staring
        nothing more

        Askance, askew
        the self's sad fancy smiles at you I swear
        at this savage viscous countenance it wears
        Though you show here shorn and shaven
        and I admit myself forlorn and craven
        ghastly grim and ancient raven
        wandering from the opiate shores
        tell me what thy lordly name is
        that you are not nightmare sewage
        some dire powder drink or inhalation
        framed from flames of downtown lore
        quotes the raven, "nevermore."

        And the raven sitting lonely
        staring sickly at my male sex only
        that one word
        as if his soul in that one word
        he did outpour, "pathetic."
        nothing farther than he uttered
        not a feather then he fluttered
        till finally was I that muttered as I stared
        dully at the floor
        "other friends have flown and left me
        flown as each and every hope has flown before
        as you no doubt will fore the morrow."
        but the bird said, "never, more."

        Then I felt the air grow denser
        perfumed from some unseen incense
        as though accepting angelic intrusion
        when in fact I felt collusion
        before the guise of false memories respite
        respite through the haze of cocaine's glory
        I smoke and smoke the blue vial's glory
        to forget
        at once
        the base Lenore
        quoth the raven, "nevermore."

        "Prophet," said I, "thing of evil
        prophet still, if bird or devil
        by that heaven that bend above us
        by that God we both ignore
        tell this soul with sorrow laden
        willful and destructive intent
        how had lapsed a pure heart lady
        to the greediest of needs
        sweaty arrogant dickless liar
        who ascribed to nothing higher
        than a jab from prick to needle
        straight to betrayal and disgrace
        the conscience showing not a trace."
        quoth the raven, "nevermore."

        "Be that word our sign of parting
        bird or fiend," I yelled upstarting
        "get thee back into the tempest
        into the smoke filled bottle's shore
        leave no black plume as a token
        of the slime thy soul hath spoken
        leave my loneliness unbroken
        quit as those have quit before
        take the talon from my heart
        and see that I can care no more
        whatever mattered came before
        I vanish with the dead Lenore."
        quoth the raven, "nevermore."

        But the raven, never flitting
        still is sitting silent sitting
        above a painting silent painting
        of the forever silenced whore
        and his eyes have all the seeming
        of a demon's that is dreaming
        and the lamplight over him
        streaming throws his shadow to the floor
        I love she who hates me more
        I love she who hates me more
        and my soul shall not be lifted from that shadow
        nevermore

The Wiltern, Los Angeles
========================


        Once upon a midnight dreary
        as I pondered, weak and weary
        over many a quaint and curious
        volume of forgotten lore
        while I nodded, nearly napping
        suddenly there came a tapping
        as of some one gently rapping
        rapping at my chamber door
        "'Tis some visitor," I muttered
        "tapping at my chamber door
        only this, only this and nothing more."

        Muttering I got up weakly
        I've always had trouble sleeping
        stumbling upright my mind racing
        furtive thoughts flowing once more
        I, there hoping for some sunrise
        happiness would be a surprise
        loneliness no longer a prize
        rapping at my chamber door
        seeking out the clever bore
        lost in dreams forever more
        only this and nothing more

        Hovering my pulse was racing
        stale tobacco my lips tasting
        scotch sitting upon my basin
        remnants of the night before
        came again
        infernal tapping on the door
        in my mind jabbing
        is it in or outside rapping
        calling out to me once more
        the fit and fury of Lenore
        nameless here forever more

        And the silken sad uncertain
        rustling of the purple curtain
        thrilled me, filled me
        with fantastic terrors never felt before

        hoping yet to calm my breathing
        "'Tis some visitor entreating
        entrance at my chamber door
        some lost visitor entreating
        entrance at my chamber door
        that it is, and nothing more."

        Deep into the darkness peering
        long I stood there

        doubting dreaming fantasies
        no mortal dared to dream before

        I gagged and shuddered

        flown as each and every hope has flown before

        But then I felt the air grow denser

"The Raven"
========================================
from the play _POEtry_
(Robert Wilson/Lou Reed, 2000)

performed by actors, local musicians (?)

May 09, 2001
Muziek Theater, Amsterdam, Holland
========================================


        Once upon a midnight dreary,
        while I pondered, weak and weary,
        Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
        While I nodded,
        nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
        As of some one gently rapping,
        rapping at my chamber door.
        "'Tis some visiter," I muttered,
        "tapping at my chamber door --
        Only this, and nothing more."

        (Nothing more)

        Ah, distinctly I remember
        it was in the bleak December,
        And each separate dying ember
        wrought its ghost upon the floor.
        Eagerly I wished the morrow; --
        vainly I had sought to borrow
        From my books surcease of sorrow --
        sorrow for the lost Lenore --
        For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name
        Lenore --
        Nameless here for evermore.

        And the silken sad
        uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
        Thrilled me --
        filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
        So that now, to still the beating of my heart,
        I stood repeating
        "'Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door --
        Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door; --
        This it is, and nothing more."

        Presently my soul grew stronger;
        hesitating then no longer,
        "Sir," said I, "or Madam,
        truly your forgiveness I implore;
        But the fact is I was napping,
        and so gently you came rapping,
        And so faintly you came tapping,
        tapping at my chamber door,
        That I scarce was sure I heard you" --
        here I opened wide the door; ----
        Darkness there and nothing more.

        Deep into that darkness peering,
        long I stood there wondering, fearing,
        Doubting,
        dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
        But the silence was unbroken,
        and the stillness gave no token,
        And the only word there spoken
        was the whispered word, "Lenore!"
        This I whispered,
        and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!" --
        Merely this, and nothing more.

        Back into the chamber turning,
        all my soul within me burning,
        Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
        "Surely," said I,
        "surely that is something at my window lattice;
        Let me see, then, what thereat is,
        and this mystery explore --
        Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;--
        'Tis the wind and nothing more!"

        Open here I flung the shutter,
        when, with many a flirt and flutter,
        In there stepped a stately raven
        of the saintly days of yore;
        Not the least obeisance made he;
        not a minute stopped or stayed he;
        But, with mien of lord or lady,
        perched above my chamber door --
        Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door --
        Perched, and sat, and nothing more.

        Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
        By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
        "Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said,
        "art sure no craven,
        Ghastly grim and ancient raven
        wandering from the Nightly shore --
        Tell me what thy lordly name is
        on the Night's Plutonian shore!"
        Quoth the raven "Nevermore."

        And the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only
        That one word,
        as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
        Nothing farther then he uttered --
        not a feather then he fluttered --
        Till I scarcely more than muttered
        "Other friends have flown before --
        On the morrow he will leave me,
        as my hopes have flown before."
        But the bird said "Nevermore."

        (We go home)

        Then, methought, the air grew denser,
        perfumed from an unseen censer
        Swung by seraphim whose foot-falls
        tinkled on the tufted floor.
        "Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee --
        by these angels he hath sent thee
        Respite -- respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;
        Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe
        and forget this lost Lenore!"
        Quoth the raven, "Nevermore."

        (Never)
        (Never)
        (Never)

        "Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil --
        prophet still, if bird or devil!
        By that Heaven that bends above us --
        by that God we both adore --
        Tell this soul with sorrow laden if,
        within the distant Aidenn,
        It shall clasp a sainted maiden
        whom the angels name Lenore --
        Clasp a rare and radiant maiden
        whom the angels name Lenore."
        Quoth the raven, "Nevermore."

        "Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!"
        I shrieked, upstarting --
        "Get thee back into the tempest
        and the Night's Plutonian shore!
        Leave no black plume as a token of that lie
        thy soul hath spoken!
        Leave my loneliness unbroken! --
        quit the bust above my door!
        Take thy beak from out my heart,
        and take thy form from off my door!"
        Quoth the raven, "Nevermore."

        And the raven, never flitting,
        still is sitting, still is sitting
        On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
        And his eyes
        have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
        And the lamp-light o'er him streaming
        throws his shadow on the floor;
        And my soul
        from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
        Shall be lifted -- nevermore!

        It must be nice to have a home
        that always stays under your feet
        that can always be depended on
        one place to eat and sleep

        How nice it must be to have a rug
        on which to stretch your legs
        a T-bone steak beside me
        I want to be a dog

        It must be nice to have a home
        A place that you can trust
        it stays forever in one spot
        and never moves about

        How nice it is to have a fire lit
        and stretch out on a rug
        a meaty bone next to my nose
        I want to be a dog

        I want to be a dog
        I want to be a dog
        With a T-bone in my paws
        I want to be a dog

        Lovely day
        The sunshine
        A light of love, love divine
        As time strode away

        A test of love
        I bring to you my love
        like a bird who builds your unborn a home
        full of warmth
        I give to you the same test of love

        Revien Cherie
        Revien Cherie

        Sitting all alone in a daze
        I sing a song to you my love
        I wish I were dead, mmmm..
        My love was far away

        A test of love
        I bring to you my love
        like a bird who builds your unborn a home
        full of warmth
        I give to you the same test of love

        Revien Cherie
        Revien Cherie

        Life to me is a share
        To be, to see, to understand each other
        To love one another
        I give to you the same test of love

I have the lyrics for Revien Cherie from Animal Serenade.


Lovely day
The sunshine
A light of love
Love divine
As time strode away

A test of love
I bring to you my love
Like a bird who builds your unborn a home
Full of warmth
I give to you the same test of love
Revien cherie
Revien cherie

Sitting all alone in a daze
I sing a song to you my love
I wish I were dead
My love was far away

A test of love
I bring to you my love
Like a bird who builds your unborn a home
Full of warmth
I give to you the same test of love
Revien cherie
Revien cherie

Life to me is a share
To be, to see, to understand each other
To love one another
I give to you the same test of love
Revien cherie
Revien cherie
Revien cherie

"Ride Into The Sun"
===================
album _Lou Reed_
(Lou Reed, 1972)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        Looking for another chance
        for someone else to be
        Looking for another place
        to ride into the sun

        Ride into the sun
        ride into the sun
        Ride into the sun
        ride into the sun
        Where -

        - everything seems so pretty
        but if you're tired and you're sick of the city
        Remember that it's just a flower
        made out of clay
        Oh oh oh, the city -

        - where everything seems so dirty
        but if you're tired and you're filled with self-pity
        Remember that you're just one more
        person who's there

        Sit yourself down
        bang out a tune on that grand piano
        Sit yourself down
        lay languidly down upon the sofa

"Riptide"
================================
album _Set The Twilight Reeling_
(Lou Reed, 1996)

written by Lou Reed
================================


        She's out of her mind
        like the wind in a storm
        Oh, like the ocean at dawn
        as it disappears, with the riptide

        She's out of her mind
        she's pulled away by the moon
        She's ripped from her sleep
        as the cold lunar sweep gains control

        Ooohhh, what you gonna do with your emotions
        Ah-ah, ones you barely recognize
        In your sleep I heard your screaming, ooohhh
        "This is not voluntary, this is not voluntary
        If this is life I'd rather die"

        In the riptide
        in the riptide

        She's out of her mind, riptide
        like a muscle that swells
        You know when you trip
        whether you're well or sick, your body aches

        She's out with the tide
        gone to a prisoner's dance
        Where a monkey's her date
        eating limbs off a plate with a spoon

        Ooohhh, what you gonna do with your emotions
        said the seagull to the loon
        What you gonna do with your emotions

        She said, "Please wake me up"
        She said, "Don't touch me now"
        She said, "I wish I was dead"

        With the riptide

        She's out of her mind
        riptide, you always win
        It happens over and over again
        riptide

        She's out of her mind
        like a hurricane's rain
        She does not stand a chance
        at this lunar dance, riptide

        I was thinking of van Gogh's last painting
        the wheatfields and the crows
        Is that perhaps what you've been feeling
        When you see the ground
        as you fall from the sky
        As the floors disappears from beneath your feet riptide

        She's going out of her mind
        out with the tide
        Out of her mind
        riptide

        She's going out of her mind, ah
        ah, with the riptide
        She's going out of her mind, ah
        ah, riptide

"Rock And Roll"
==============================
album _Loaded_
(The Velvet Underground, 1970)

written by Lou Reed
==============================


        Jenny said when she was just five years old
        there was nothin' happening at all
        Every time she puts on the radio
        there was nothin' goin' down at all
        not at all

        Then one fine mornin', she puts on a New York station
        you know she couldn't believe what she heard at all
        She started shakin' to that fine-fine music
        you know her life was saved by rock 'n' roll

        Despite all the amputations
        you know you could just go out
        and dance to the rock 'n' roll station
        And it was all right, hey baby, you know
        it was all right

        Jenny said when she was just about five years old
        you know my parents are gonna be the death of us all
        Two TV sets and two Cadillac cars
        well you know ain't gonna help me at all
        not just you ....

        Then one fine morning, she turns on a New York station
        she doesn't believe what she hears at all
        Ooohhh, she started dancin' to that fine fine music
        you know her life was saved by rock 'n' roll
        yeah, rock 'n' roll

        Despite all the computations
        you could just dance to that rock 'n' roll station
        And baby, it was all right
        hey, it was all right
        hey, here she comes now

        Oh, jump-jump

        Like Jenny said when she was just about five-five years old
        hey, you know there's nothin' happening at all
        not at all
        Every time I put on the radio
        you know there's nothin' goin' down at all
        not at all

        But one fine morning, she hears a New York station
        she doesn't believe what she heard at all
        hey, not at all
        She started dancing to that fine fine music
        you know her life was saved by rock 'n' roll
        yes, rock 'n' roll

        Ooohhh, despite all the computations
        You know you could just dance to the rock 'n' roll station

        All right, all right
        And it was all right
        oh, you listen to me now
        It was all right
        come on now, believe me
        It was all right, it was all right
        Hey, it's all right, hey, it's all right
        hey, it's all right now, hey, it's all right now
        Hey, it's all right, hey, it's all right, now
        hey, it's all right now, hey, it's all right now
        Oh baby, oh baby

        Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
        any old way you choose it
        It's got a back beat you can't lose it
        well any old time you use it
        It's gotta be rock and roll music
        Well if you wanna dance with me
        yeah, if you wanna dance with me


        I took my love on over across the tracks
        so she ....... heard a man a-wailin' sax
        I got said they had a rockin band
        well they were blowing like a hurricane

        And ...... playing that rock and roll music
        any old way you choose it
        It's got a back beat you can't lose it
        any old time you use it
        It's gotta be rock and roll music
        Well if you wanna dance with me
        if you wanna dance with me

        I got no kick against modern jazz
        unless you try to play it too darn fast
        I lose the beauty of a melody
        until it sounds just like a symphony

        That's why I go for that rock and roll music
        any old way you choose it
        It's got a back beat you can't lose it
        any old time you use it
        It's gotta be rock and roll music
        If you wanna dance with me
        if you wanna dance with me

        And Way down south they gave a jubilee
        and Georgia folks, they had a jamboree
        They're drinking home brew from a wooden cup
        the folks dancing got all shook up

        And started playing that rock and roll music
        any old way you choose it
        It's got a back beat you can't lose it
        any old time you use it
        It's gotta be rock and roll music
        If you wanna dance with me

"Rock Minuet"
===================
album _Ecstasy_
(Lou Reed, 2000)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        Paralyzed by hatred and a piss ugly soul
        if he murdered his father, he thought he'd become whole
        While listening at night to an old radio
        where they danced to the rock minuet

        In the gay bars in the back of the bar
        he consummated hatred on a cold sawdust floor
        While the jukebox played backbeats, he sniffed coke off a jar
        while they danced to a rock minuet

        School was a waste, he was meant for the street
        but school was the only way, the army could be beat
        The two whores sucked his nipples 'til he came on their feet
        as they danced to the rock minuet

        He dreamt that his father was sunk to his knees
        his leather belt tied so tight that it was hard to breathe
        And the studs from his jacket were as cold as a breeze
        as he danced to a rock minuet

        He pictured the bedroom where he heard the first cry
        his mother on all fours, ah, with his father behind
        And her yell hurt so much, he had wished he'd gone blind
        and rocked to a rock minuet

        In the back of the warehouse were a couple of guys
        they had tied someone up and sewn up their eyes
        And he got so excited he came on his thighs
        when they danced to the rock minuet

        On Avenue B, someone cruised him one night
        he took him in an alley and then pulled a knife
        And thought of his father, as he cut his windpipe
        and finally danced to the rock minuet

        In the curse of the alley, the thrill of the street
        on the bitter cold docks where the outlaws all meet
        In euphoria drug in euphoria heat
        you could dance to the rock minuet

        In the thrill of the needle and anonymous sex
        you could dance to the rock minuet

        So when you dance hard, slow dancing
        when you dance hard, slow dancing
        When you dance hard, slow dancing
        when you dance to the rock minuet

"Rock Minuet"
===========================================
album _Berlin: Live At St. Ann's Warehouse_
(Lou Reed, 2008)

Dec 15 (or 16), 2006
St. Ann's Warehouse, Brooklyn, NY
===========================================


        Paralyzed by hatred and a piss ugly soul
        if he murdered the old man, he thought he'd become whole
        While listening at night to an old radio
        where they danced to the rock minuet

        In the gay bars in the back of the bar
        he consummated hatred on a cold sawdust floor
        While the jukebox played backbeats, he sniffed coke off a jar
        while they danced to a rock minuet

        School was a waste, he was meant for the street
        but school was the only way that the army could be beat
        The two whores sucked his nipples 'til he came on their feet
        as they danced to the rock minuet

        He dreamt that the old man was sunk to his knees
        the leather belt tied so tight that it was hard to breathe
        And the studs from his jacket were as cold as a breeze
        as he danced to a rock minuet

        He pictured the bedroom where he heard the first cry
        Mama on all fours, with daddy behind
        And her yell hurt so much, he had wished he'd gone blind
        and rocked to a rock minuet

        In the back of the warehouse were a couple of guys
        they'd tied someone up and sewn up their eyes
        And he got so excited he came on his thighs
        when they danced to the rock minuet

        On Avenue B, someone cruised him one night
        he took him in an alley and then pulled a knife
        And he thought of the old man, as he cut his windpipe
        and finally danced to the rock minuet

        In the curse of the alley, the thrill of the street
        on the bitter cold docks where the outlaws all meet
        In euphoria drug in euphoria heat
        you could dance to the rock minuet

        In the thrill of the needle and anonymous sex
        you could dance to a rock minuet

        So when you dance hard, slow dancing
        when you dance hard, slow dancing
        When you dance hard, slow dancing
        when you dance to a rock minuet

not just lyrics I copied from the booklet.



Rock minuet
-------------
Paralyzed by hatred and a piss ugly soul
If he murdered his father he thought he'd become whole
While listening at night to an old radio
Where they danced to the rock minuet

In the gay bars in the back of the bar
He consummated hatred on a cold sawdust floor
While the jukebox played backbeats
He sniffed coke off a jar
While they danced to a rock minuet

School was a waste he was meant for the street
But school was the only way the army could be beat
The two whores sucked his nipples until he came on their feet
As they danced to the rock minuet

He dreamt that his father was sunk to his knees
His leather belt tied so tight that it was hard to breathe
And the studs from his jacket were as cold as a breeze
As he danced to a rock minuet

He pictured the bedroom where he heard the first cry
His mother on all fours, aah, with his father behind
And her yell hurt so much, he had wished he'd gone blind
And rocked to a rock minuet

In the back of the warehouse were a couple of guys
They had tied someone up and sewn up their eyes
And he got so excited he came on his thighs
When they danced to the rock minuet

On Avenue B someone cruised him one night
He took him in an alley and then pulled a knife
And thought of his father, as he cut his windpipe
And finally danced to the rock minuet

In the curse of the alley the thrill of the street
On the bitter cold docks
Where the outlaws all meet
In euphoria drug in euphoria heat
You could dance to the rock minuet
In the thrill of the needle and anonymous sex
You could dance to the rock minuet

So when you dance hard, slow dancing
When you dance hard, slow dancing
When you dance hard, slow dancing
When you dance to the rock minuet

"Romeo Had Juliette"
====================
album _New York_
(Lou Reed, 1989)

written by Lou Reed

* with false start
====================


        Caught between the twisted stars
        the plotted lines the faulty map
        that brought Columbus to New York
        Betwixt between the East and West
        he calls on her wearing a leather vest
        the earth squeals and shudders to a halt
        A diamond crucifix in his ear
        is used to help ward off the fear
        that he has left his soul in someone's rented car
        Inside his pants he hides a mop
        to clean the mess that he has dropped
        into the life of lithesome Juliette Bell

        And Romeo wanted Juliette
        and Juliette wanted Romeo
        And Romeo wanted Juliette
        and Juliette wanted Romeo

        Romeo Rodriguez squares
        his shoulders and curses
        Jesus runs a comb through his black pony-tail
        He's thinking of his lonely room
        the sink that by his bed gives off a stink
        then smells her perfume in his eyes
        And her voice was like a bell

        Outside the streets were steaming
        the crack dealers were dreaming
        of an Uzi someone had just scored
        I betcha I could hit that light
        with my one good arm behind my back
        says little Joey Diaz
        Brother, give me another tote
        those downtown hoods are no damn good
        those Italians need a lesson to be taught
        This cop who died in Harlem
        you think they'd get the warnin'
        I was dancing when I saw his brains run out on the street

        And Romeo had Juliette
        and Juliette had her Romeo
        And Romeo had Juliette
        and Juliette had her Romeo

        I'll take Manhattan in a garbage bag
        with Latin written on it that says
        "It's hard to give a shit these days"
        Manhattan's sinking like a rock
        into the filthy Hudson what a shock
        they wrote a book about it
        they said it was like Ancient Rome

        The perfume burned his eyes
        holding tightly to her thighs
        And something flickered for a minute
        and then it vanished and was gone

"Romeo Had Juliette"
===================================
album _The United States Of Poetry_
(Various Artists, 1996)

* poetry reading by Lou Reed
===================================


        Caught between the twisted stars
        The plotted lines the faulty map
        That brought Columbus to New York

        Betwixt between the East and West
        he calls on her wearing a leather vest
        The earth squeals and shudders to a halt

        A diamond crucifix in his ear
        is used to help ward off the fear
        that he has left his soul in someone's
        Rented car

        Inside his pants he hides a mop
        To clean the mess that he has dropped into the life of
        Lithesome Juliette Bell

        Romeo had Juliette
        Juliette had her Romeo

        Romeo Rodriguez
        Squares his shoulders and curses Jesus runs his
        hands his black pony-tail
        He's thinking of his lonely room the sink that by his bed
        Gives off a stink
        Then smells her perfume in his eyes
        and her voice was like a bell

        Outside the streets were steaming
        Crack dealers were dreaming of an Uzi someone had scored
        I betcha I could hit that light with my
        one good arm behind my back says little Joey Diaz

        Brother, give me another tote
        Those downtown hoods are no damn good
        those Italians need a lesson to be taught

        This cop who died in Harlem
        You think they'd get the warnin'
        I was laughing when his brains run out on the street

        And Romeo had Juliette
        And Juliette had her Romeo

        He'll take Manhattan in a garbage bag
        with Latin written on it that says
        "It's hard to give a shit these days"

        Manhattan's sinking like a rock
        into the filthy Hudson what a shock
        they wrote a book about it
        They said it was like Ancient Rome

        Perfume burned his eyes
        Holding tightly
        to her thighs and something flickered for a minute
        And then it vanished and was gone

Here's some riffs from Lou Reed's distinguished career
that aren't yet on your cool web site. I hope you enjoy them.


ROMEO HAD JULIETTE

For most of the song he plays riffs
based on the open A, E and D chords.
I think these are mostly improvised,
but the following 2 patterns recur lots of times:

A           E         D         D
e------------------0----2------2--2-
B-2--------2--0------0--3---------3-
G-2--2--4-----1-1-------2--0h2----2-
D-2-----------2---------------------
A-----------------------------------
E-----------------------------------

A           E         D         D
e-------------------0---2------2--2-
B-2--2---2----0--0---0--3---------3-
G-2-2-2-4-2---1-1-1-----2--0h2--2-2-
D-2-----------2---------------------
A-----------------------------------
E-----------------------------------

Exactly how to play these riffs
depends on how much distortion you are using.
If playing clean, play the full E, A and D chords,
if using lots of distortion play only 3 strings as shown in the tab.
To sound like the record use some distortion, but not too much.

Several other riffs happen in the spaces between the lyrics.
I think this is like one of them:

e-5h7-7-7-7-7-5-----------------5-------5-
B---------------5-7-7-7-7-7-5---7-----7-7-
G-----------------------------5-7-5h7---7-
D-------------------------------7-------7-
A-------------------------------5-------5-
E-----------------------------------------

"Rooftop Garden"
========================
album _Legendary Hearts_
(Lou Reed, 1983)

written by Lou Reed
========================


        Sitting in our rooftop garden
        looking down below
        Sitting in our rooftop garden
        waiting for the sun

        Isn't it lovely watching
        a plane go by
        What a lovely couple
        are you and I

        Sitting in our rooftop garden
        a few drops of rain
        The lights in the city blinking on
        just the same

        No sugar in my coffee
        how's your tea
        In our rooftop garden
        above the city

        Let's not see any letters
        let's not answer the phone
        Let's just pretend that
        there's no one at home

        In our rooftop garden
        in our rooftop garden
        In our rooftop garden
        up on the roof

"Run Run Run"
=======================================
album _The Velvet Underground and Nico_
(The Velvet Underground, 1967)

written by Lou Reed
=======================================


        Teenage Mary said to Uncle Dave
        I sold my soul, must be saved
        Gonna take a walk down Union Square
        you never know who you gonna find there

        You gotta run run run run run
        take a drag or two
        Run run run run run
        gypsy death and you, tell you what to do

        Margarita Passion I had to get her fixed
        she wasn't well, she's getting sick
        Went to sell her soul, she wasn't high
        didn't know things she could buy

        And she would run run run run run
        take a drag or two
        Run run run run run
        gypsy death and you, tell you what to do

        Seasick Sarah had a golden nose
        hard-nailed boots wrapped around her toes
        When she turned blue, all the angels screamed
        they didn't know, they couldn't make the scene

        She had to run run run run run
        take a drag or two
        Run run run run run
        gypsy death and you, tell you what to do

        Beardless Harry, what a waste
        couldn't even get a small town taste
        Rode the trolleys down to forty-seven
        figured if he was good, he'd get himself to heaven

        'Cause he had to run run run run run
        take a drag or two
        Run run run run run
        gypsy death and you, tell you what to do

I think the line in Run Run Run shown as "hard-nailed boots"
is actually "hob-nailed boots"

Here is a HUGE one for you- from "run run run" on banana album etc:


        You gotta run run run run run
        take a drag or two
        Run run run run run
        gypsy death and you, tell you what to do

the correct lyrics are:

"You gotta run run run- take your jacket too-
run run run run run- trip 5th avenue"

ie being high on 5th ave in new york beauty!

"Sad About It"
=========================================
album _Wild Angel_
(Nelson Slater, 1976)

written by Nelson Slater

Lou Reed:
produce, piano, guitar, background vocals
=========================================


        I could choose another way to say it
        but I'll put it in these blues and play it
        And it's not another way to get you
        but if you want to take a listen I'll let you

        You understand I had to turn the tide
        or be taken for another ride
        I'm not sorry I decided to
        never take another step with you

        But I'm sad about it
        not down to where I'm lost in pain
        but I'm sad about it
        I just thought I'd better make it plain
        But I'm sad about it
        that's nothing but a fact
        I'm sad about it
        let's leave the way I feel at that

        I just had another lonely night
        that's something I don't really mind
        'Cause it's living and it feels alright
        it is better than the chokin' kind

        It doesn't have to be a lasting thing
        to leave memories that really sting
        I'm just glad I never went too far
        to lose sight of what you really are

        But I'm sad about it
        not down to where I'm lost in pain
        but I'm sad about it
        I just thought I'd better make it plain
        And I'm sad about it
        that's nothing but a natural fact
        I'm sad about it
        let's leave the way I feel at that

        I don't really care enough to shout it
        not even gonna cry about it
        Actually I'm feeling kind of good without it
        but I'm sad about it

        But I'm sad about it
        sad about it
        Sad about it

        I'm sad about it
        sad about it, sad about it
        Sad about it, sad about it
        sad about it, sad about it
        Sad about it, sad about it
        sad about it, I'm sad about it
        Yes, I am sad about it, so sad about it
        feelin' sad about it, I'm sad
        Don't you know that sad about it, sad about it
        sad about it, sad about it
        Sad about it, sad about it
        sad about it, sad about it
        Sad about it, sad about it
        yeah

(Lou Reed, 1973)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        Staring at my picture book
        she looks like Mary, Queen of Scots
        She seemed very regal to me
        just goes to show how wrong you can be

        I'm gonna stop wasting my time
        Somebody else would have broken both of her arms

        Sad song, sad song
        Sad song, sad song

        My castle, kids and home
        I thought she was Mary, Queen of Scots
        I tried so very hard
        shows just how wrong you can be

        I'm gonna stop wasting time
        Somebody else would have broken both of her arms

"Safety Zone"
==========================================================
music inspired by the film _Nanking_ - single (audio file)
(Lou Reed, 2007)

written by Lou Reed
==========================================================


        I thought I make a safety zone
        With the doctor and the sister
        I thought I make a safety zone
        I thought I make a bridge
        keep civilian over here
        I thought I build a safety zone
        I thought I build a safety zone
        I thought I bring together
        a hospital, a school and my home

        Side step and morality
        that isn't me
        I thought with my heart
        I thought I build a safety zone

        The Japanese in this war
        brought us to our collective knees
        I am asking please
        can we all agree on one thing, please

        Here a proper let a civilian send to state the obvious
        and thought it seems too late
        I'm asking please
        can we take care of safety zone

        Dear general
        may we build a safety zone
        We're asking please
        may we build a safety zone

        Lives fly by in a minute
        rape at the end of a bayonet
        The sick and the elderly may
        we build a safety zone

        Lives fly by in a minute
        stock through the end of a bayonet
        Nothing to fear from here
        may we build a safety zone

        We're gonna starve or freeze
        may we build a safety zone
        Starve or freeze
        may we build a safety zone

        Dear general
        may we build a safety zone
        Starve or freeze
        starve or freeze
        Starve or freeze
        may we build a safety zone

"Sally Can't Dance"
=========================
album _Sally Can't Dance_
(Lou Reed, 1974)

written by Lou Reed
=========================


        Sally dances on the floor
        she says that she can't do it anymore
        She walks down St. Mark's Place
        and eats natural food at my place

        Now Sally can't dance no more
        she can't get it off of the floor
        Sally can't dance no more
        they found her in the trunk of a Ford
        ooohhh, she can't dance no more

        Sally is losing her face
        she lives on St. Mark's Place
        In a rent-controlled apartment, 80 dollars a month
        she has lots of fun, she has lots of fun, but -

        Sally can't dance no more, ooohhh
        Sally can't dance no more
        She took too much meth and can't get off the floor
        now Sally, she can't dance no more

        She was the first girl in the neighborhood
        to wear tie-dyed pants, a like a she should
        She was the first girl that I ever seen
        that had flowers painted on her jeans
        She was the first girl in her neighborhood
        who got raped on Tompkins Square, real good
        Now she wears a sword like Napoleon
        and she kills the boys and acts like a son

        Sally can't dance no more, ooohhh
        now Sally can't dance no more
        She can't get herself off the floor, ah-huh
        Sally, ooohhh, she can't dance no more

        Watch this now

        Sally became a big model

        There's one kind favor that I ask of you
        There's one kind favor that I ask of you
        There's one kind favor that I ask of you
        Won't you please
        Please see my grave's kept clean

        Long line ain't got no end
        Lord, there's a long line that ain't got no end
        mmmm..
        It's a long long line that ain't got no end
        Bad wind that never came
        It's a bad wind that never came

        Two white horses standing in line
        There's two white horses standing in line
        There's two white horses
        and they're standing in line
        Take me to that burying ground
        Take me to that burying ground

        My heart stopped beating and my hands are cold
        My heart stopped beating and my hands are cold
        Well my heart stopped beating
        and my hands were cold
        It was along what the Good Book said
        what the Bible told
        What the Bible told

        Have you ever heard that coffin sound
        Have you ever heard that coffin sound
        Have you ever heard that coffin sound
        Did you know that this poor boy's beneath the ground
        Don't you know this poor boy's neath the ground

        Dig my grave with a silver spade
        Why don't you dig my grave with a silver spade
        Why don't you dig my grave with a silver spade
        Ah, lay me down with a golden chain
        Why don't you lay me down with a golden chain

        Have you ever heard the church bell song
        Ah, have you heard the church bell song
        Have you ever heard that church bell song
        You know that this poor boy's dead and gone
        You know this poor boy's dead and gone

        One kind favor that I ask of you
        There's one kind favor that I ask of you

        One kind favor that I ask of you, ah
        Please see that my grave's kept clean

        When I was a poor young boy at school
        Girls like you always played me for a fool
        But now a time has come to lay to waste
        The theory people have of getting an acquired taste
        you treated me -

        Oh, so so senselessly cruel
        Oh baby, you were so senselessly cruel

        From the beginnings I suspected the worst
        And you didn't disappoint me
        it was just that you were the first
        But now I wouldn't let you touch me
        if you were within a foot
        And girl, I'm never ever gonna get hurt
        'cause you treated me -

        Oh, so now senselessly cruel

"September Song"
===================================================
album _Lost In The Stars - The Music Of Kurt Weill_
(Various Artists, 1985)

written by Kurt Weill/Maxwell Anderson

arranged by Lou Reed
===================================================


        When I was a young man courting the girls
        I played me a waiting game
        If a maid refused me with tossing curls, oh
        I let the old earth, take a couple of whirls
        While I plied her with tears in place of pearls
        and as time came around she came my way
        As time came around she came

        For it's a long-long while
        from May to December
        And the days grow short
        when you reach September

        And I have lost my teeth
        and I'm walking in the little rain
        Hey honey, I haven't got the time
        for any waiting game

        And the days turn to gold
        as they grow few
        September
        November

        And these few golden days
        I'd like to spend them with you
        These golden days
        I'd like to spend them with you

        And the days dwindle down
        to a precious few
        September
        November

        And I'm not quite equipped
        for these waiting games
        I have a little money
        and I've had a little pain

        And these few golden days
        as the days grow so few
        These golden days
        I'd like to spend them with you
        These precious golden days
        I'd like to spend them with you

"September Song"
=================================================
album _September Songs - The Music Of Kurt Weill_
(Original Soundtrack, 1997)

arranged by Lou Reed
=================================================


        When I was a young man courting the girls
        I played a waiting game
        If a maid refused me with tossing curls, ah
        I let the old earth, take a couple of whirls
        While I plied her with tears and the lieu of pearls
        and as time came around she came my way
        As time came around she came

        It's a long-long while
        From May to December
        But the days grow short
        When you reach September

        When the autumn, autumn weather
        Turns the leaves to flame
        One hasn't got the time
        For the waiting game

        The days disappear
        The days disappear .....
        September
        November

        These few precious days
        I'll spend with you, mmmm..
        These precious days
        I'II spend with you

        Oh, the days disappear
        Disappear, down to a precious few
        September
        November

        These few precious days
        I'll spend them with you
        These precious days
        I want to spend them with you
        These precious days
        I want to spend them with you

September Song


When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me the waiting game
If a maid refused me with a tossing curls, oh
I let the old earth, take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in prays of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around she came

For its a long, long while, from May to December
And the days grow short, when you reach September

And I have the lost my tears
and the walking in the little rain
Hey honey, I haven't gotta time for gaining Waiting Game

And the days turn to crawl (or "grow old") as they grow few
September, November

And these few colding (or "colden") days
I'd like to spend 'em with you
These golden days, I'd like to spend 'em with you

And the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November

And I'm not quite a quip for the waiting game
I have a little money, and I have a little pain

And these few golden days, as the days grow so few
These golden days, I'd like to spend 'em with you
These precious golden days, I'd like to spend 'em with you
September song, September song
September song, September song

I write, not only to thank you for this collection,
but to suggest that the transcription of Kurt Weil's
"September Song,"
as performed on "Lost in the Stars,"
could be made a little more accurate.

The following suggestions are based on two different sources.
First, in some places,
corrections become clear by applying rules of grammar
which are common knowledge to native speakers of English,
but which might not be so clear to nonnative speakers.
Second, from my own experience of listening to Lou Reed's cover
of this song many times over a period of years.
(One caveat: I am doing this from memory --
i don't have Lost in the Stars nearby to check myself).
In any event, the following suggested changes should result
in a truer transcription of Lou Reed's deliver of Weil's song:


the transcript reads:

    "While I plied her with tears in prays of pearls."

it should be:

    "While I plied her with tears in place of pearls.";

the transcript reads:

    "For its a long, long while"

it should be:

    "Well, it's a long, long while"
(I'm not entirely sure of this -- need to listen to it again)

the transcript reads:

    "And I have the lost my tears"

it should be:

    "And I have lost my teeth"
(remember, this song is, among other things, about getting old,
and losing teeth is one of the song's strong images
of the ravages of old age...)

the transcript reads:

    "Hey honey, I haven't gotta time"

it should be:

    "Hey honey, I haven't got the time"
(Note that he really enunciates this clearly;
further, "gotta," which is generally a slang contraction for
"got to,"
just does not grammatically fit here.)

the transcript reads:

    "for gaining waiting game"

it should be:

    "for any waiting game"

the transcript reads:

    "And the days turn to grow old"

it should be:

    "And the days turn to gold"
("... turn to grow old" does not make grammatical sense
(and this is decidedly not a nonsense song,
nor is it one that "plays fast and loose"
with grammar to utter nonlinear,
impressionistic collections of images,
like, for example, Courtney Love does in her song "Plump"
from Hole's album "Live Through This"),
while "turn to gold" does make sense as the completion of the line
as well as in the larger context of the song;
in addition, "the days turn to gold"
works to set up the climax in the song:
"these precious golden days, I want to spend them with you")

the transcript reads
(four times -- second and fourth line of 5th stanza,
and 4th and 6th line of 7th stanza):

    "I'd like to spend 'em with you"

it should be:

    "I'd like to spend them with you"

the transcript reads:

    "And the days dwindle down"

it should be:

    "As the days dwindle down"
(?? I need to listen to this again to be sure,
but, even without checking,
"as" makes more sense syntactically and logically than "and.")

the transcript reads:

    "And I'm not quite a equip"

it should be:

    "And I'm not quite equipped"

"Set The Twilight Reeling"
================================
album _Set The Twilight Reeling_
(Lou Reed, 1996)

written by Lou Reed
================================


        Take me for what I am
        a star newly emerging
        Long simmering explodes
        inside the self is reeling
        In the pocket of the heart, in the rushing of the blood
        in the muscle of my sex, in the mindful mindless love
        I accept the new found man
        and I set the twilight reeling

        At 5 a.m. the moon and sun
        sit set before my window
        Light glances off the blue glass we set
        right before the window
        And you who accept, in your soul and your head
        what was misunderstood, what was thought of with dread
        a new self is borne, the other self dead
        I accept the new found man
        and set the twilight reeling

        A soul singer stands on the stage
        the spotlight shows him sweating
        He sinks to one knee, seems to cry
        the horns are unrelenting
        But as the drums beat he finds himself growing hard
        in the microphone's face he sees her face growing large
        and the swelling crescendo no longer retards
        I accept the new found man
        and set the twilight reeling

        As the twilight sunburst gleams
        as the chromium moon it sets
        As I lose all my regrets
        and set the twilight reeling
        I accept the new found man
        and set the twilight reeling

Sony Music Studios, NYC
(WNET - Sessions At West 54th)
=========================================


        Take me for what I am
        a star newly emerging
        Long simmering explodes
        inside the self is reeling
        From the muscle in the heart, in the rushing of the blood
        the muscle of my sex, in the mindless mindful love
        oh, mindful love
        I accept the new found man
        and I set the twilight reeling

        At 5 a.m. the moon and sun
        sit set before my window
        Light glances off the blue glass we set
        right before the window
        And you who accept, in your mind and your head
        what was misunderstood, what was thought of with dread
        and a new self is borne, and the other self dead
        I says I
        and I says I
        And I says I
        gonna set the twilight reeling

        Soul singer stands on the stage
        the spotlight shows him sweating
        He sinks to one knee, he seems to cry
        the horns are unrelenting, baby
        As the drums beat he finds his face growing large
        in the microphone's face he sees her grace growing large
        and the swelling crescendo no longer retards
        I says now I
        ooohhh-ooohhh-wheee-ooohhh-wheee baby, I, ah
        hey, I says that I
        gonna set the twilight reeling

        As the twilight sunset gleams
        as the chromium moon it sets
        As I lose all my regrets
        set the twilight reeling
        I accept the new found man
        and set the twilight reeling

        Long simmering explodes
        inside the self is reeling
        In the pocket of the heart, in the rushing of the blood

"Sex With Your Parents (Motherfucker) Part II"
==============================================
album _Set The Twilight Reeling_
(Lou Reed, 1996)

written by Lou Reed
==============================================


        I was thinking of things that I hate to do
        Sex with your parents
        Things you do to me or I do to you, baby
        Sex with your parents, something -

        - Fatter and uglier than Rush Rambo
        Somethin' more disgusting than Robert Dole
        Somethin' pink that climbs out of a hole and there it was
        Sex with your parents

        I was getting so sick of this rightwing Republican shit
        These ugly old men scared of young tit and dick
        So I tried to think of something that made me sick
        And there it was
        Sex with your parents

        Now these old fucks can steal all they want
        And they can go and pass laws saying
        you can't say what you want
        And you can't look at this
        And you can't look at that
        And you can't smoke this
        And you can't snort that
        And me, baby, I got statistics, I got stats
        These people have been to bed with their parents

        Now I know you're shocked
        but hang and have a brew
        If you think about it for a minute
        you know that it's true
        They're ashamed and repelled
        they don't know what to do
        They've had sex with their parents
        When they looked into their lovers' eyes they saw
        Mom
        In the name of family values we must ask
        whose family
        In the name of family values we must ask
        Senator -

        It's been reported that you have had
        illegal congress with your mother
        Sex with your parents
        Ah, Senator
        An illegal congress by proxy is a pigeon by any other name
        Sex with your parents

        Senators, you polish a turd
        Here in the big city we got a word
        For those who would bed their beloved big bird
        And make a mockery of our freedoms
        Ah, without even using a condom
        Without even saying, "No"
        By God we have a name for people like that
        It's, hey, motherfucker

        When you're movin' right up close to me

        She's my best friend

        - Down down down down down down
        you know it sure hurts to be that way
        Down down down down down down
        you know it sure hurts to know that you're that kinda fella

        Ah, here's to Mullberry Jane (here's to Mullberry Jane)
        she made Jim when she came
        Somebody cut off her feet
        now Jelly rolls in the street

        If you want to see me
        well honey, you know that I'm not around
        But if you want to hear me
        why don't you just turn around
        I'm by the window where the light is

        She's my best friend
        certainly not just like your average dog or car
        She's my best friend
        she understands me when I'm feeling -

        - Down down down down down down
        you know it sure hurts to be that way
        Down down down down down down
        you know it sure hurts to know that you're that kinda fella

        Let's hear one for Newspaper Joe (Newspaper Joe)
        he caught his hand in the door (caught his hand in the door)
        Dropped his, ah, teeth on the floor
        they said, "Hey now Joe, guess that's the way the news goes"

        If you want to see, yeah, see me
        well baby, you know that I'm not around
        But if you want to feel, yeah, feel me
        why don't you just turn around
        I'm by the window where the light is

        She's my best friend
        oh, she's my, she's my best friend, give it now
        She's my best friend

album _Street Hassle_

Apr 24, 1977
Friedrich Eberthalle, Ludwigshaven
==================================


        All the people had their share of the glory
        looking out after you
        It's just a story about winners and glory
        and you know that it's true

        Ah ha, oh yeah, you're just a shooting star
        Ah ha, oh yeah, you're just a shooting star

        Some men may glory from a different condition
        of another car
        And later persuasion would permit the arranging
        of a ...
        And to cause more confusion, and to make this illusion
        would have gone too far
        And it's my ambition, of a jacket ignition
        in a Cadillac metal car

        Ah ha, oh yeah, you're just a shooting star
        Ah ha, oh yeah, you're just a shooting star
        Ah ha, oh yeah, you're just a shooting star
        Ah ha, oh yeah, you're just a shooting star

        You're just a shooting star

"Sick Of You"
===================
album _New York_
(Lou Reed, 1989)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        I was up in the morning with the TV blarin'
        brush my teeth sittin' watchin' the news
        All the beaches were closed the ocean was a Red Sea
        but there was no one there to part it in two
        There was no fresh salad
        'cause there's hypos in the cabbage
        Staten Island disappeared at noon
        And they say the Midwest is in great distress
        and NASA blew up the moon

        The ozone layer has no ozone anymore
        and you're gonna leave me for the guy next door
        I'm sick of you
        I'm sick of you

        They arrested the mayor for an illegal favor
        sold the Empire State to Japan
        And Oliver North married William Secord
        and gave birth to a little Teheran
        And the Ayatollah bought a nuclear warship
        if he dies he wants to go out in style
        And there's nothing to eat that don't carry the stink
        of some human waste dumped in the Nile

        Well one thing is certainly true
        no one here knows what to do
        And I'm sick of you
        I'm sick of you

        The radio said there were 400 dead
        in some small town in Arkansas
        Some whacked out trucker drove into a nuclear reactor
        and killed everybody he saw
        Now he's on Morton Downey and he's glowing and shining
        doctors say this is a medical advance
        They say the bad makes the good
        and there's something to be learned
        in every human experience

        Well I know one thing that really is true
        this here's a zoo and the keeper ain't you
        And I'm sick of it
        I'm sick of you

        They ordained the Trumps and then he got the mumps
        and died being treated at Mt. Sinai
        And my best friend Bill died from a poison pill
        some wired doctor prescribed for stress
        My arms and legs are shrunk, the food all has lumps
        they discovered some animal no one's ever seen
        It was an inside trader eating a rubber tire
        after running over Rudy Giuliani

        They say the president's dead, no one can find his head
        it's been missing now for weeks
        But no one noticed it, he had seemed so fit
        and I'm Sick of it

        I'm sick of you
        I'm so sick of you
        bye-bye-bye

        Bye, bye, bye

        They're busy waiting for her sailor
        who's drinking dressed in pink and leather
        He's just here from Alabama

        He aims it at the sailor
        shoots him down dead on the floor
        Oh, you shouldn't do that

        This is gonna go on for a while
        This is a story about
        a person we know in New York
        And her name is Sister Ray
        A very, very good friend of ours
        Sister Ray has a very peculiar occupation
        And because of that has certain, occupational hazards
        And so this song's about what happens down in the street
        Which I'm sure you're all familiar with
        There are five characters in this song
        Duck, Sally, Cecil, a sailor, a booster
        and Sister Ray
        Down on the Lower East Side
        Just sitting around
        Gettin' it on
        Gettin' it together

        Duck and Sally inside
        They're cookin' for the down five
        Who's staring at Miss Rayon
        Who's licking up her pig pen
        Just licking up her pig pen

        Now Rosie and Miss Rayon
        They're busy waiting for her booster
        Who just got here from Carolina
        She said she bound be a sailor
        Who's all dressed in pink and leather, ooohhh baby
        Oh, just got here from Alabama
        She said she didn't like the weather
        Wants to know had a earning dollar
        And said, hey baby, I haven't got the time-time
        She's busy sucking on my ding-dong
        She's busy sucking on my ding-dong, Jim
        Ooohhh, now just like Sister Ray said
        I'm searching for my mainline
        I said I couldn't hit it sideways
        I said I couldn't hit it sideways
        Oh, just like Sister Ray said
        play it on



        Cecil's got his new piece
        He cocks and shoots it bang between three and four
        He aims it at the sailor
        He shoots him down dead on the floor
        Oh, you shouldn't do that
        Don't you know you will mess up the carpet
        Don't you know you'll mess up the carpet, ah

        By the way, have you got a dollar
        Hey baby, I haven't any ........
        Hey baby, I haven't .... we got the time-time

        She's busy sucking on my ding-dong
        She's busy sucking on my ding-dong
        Ah, just like Sister Ray said

        I couldn't hit it sideways
        Oh, I couldn't hit it sideways
        oh, I just like Sister Ray says
        hit it to me

        I walking by my water
        straight back from Carolina
        I didn't have a ..........
        and I didn't like the weather
        Cause I haven't got the time-time
        sucking on his ding-dong
        Sucking on his ding-dong
        just like Sister Ray said
        Hey, searching for my mainline
        I couldn't hit it sideways
        I couldn't hit it sideways
        just like Sister Ray said
        suck to me

        Rosie and Miss Rayon
        they're waiting for her booster
        Dressed in pink and leather
        bound be a sailor
        Who hasn't got the time-time
        sucking on his ding-dong
        Sucking on his ding-dong
        just like Sister Ray said
        Hey, I'm searching for my mainline
        I couldn't hit it sideways
        Couldn't hit it sideways
        just like Sister Ray said
        suck to me

"Duck and Sally" in Sister Ray should be "Doc and Sally".
At least, that's what the Peel Slowly booklet says.

On the first disc of the Quine Tapes
the sister ray opening lyrics are as follows: 

This is a story about somebody named Duck and Sally, Cecil,
Miss Rosie and Miss Rayon
and other assorted friends of ours,
and the late dearly lamented,
sadly deceased and quite demented Sister Ray

On the version of the Quine Tapes on Disc 3 of Sister Ray
Reed's introduction goes like this:


This is gonna go on for a while,
This is a story about a person we know in New York,
And her name is Sister Ray,
Very, very good friend of ours,
Sister Ray has a very peculiar occupation,
And because of that has certain, occupational hazards,
And so this song's about what happens down in the street,
Which I'm sure you're all familiar with,
There are five characters in this song,
Duck, Sally, Cecil, a sailor, a booster, and Sister Ray,
Down on the Lower East Side,
Just sitting around, gettin' it on,
gettin' it together

"Slip Away" (A Warning)
=============================
album _Songs For Drella_
(Lou Reed/John Cale, 1990)

written by Lou Reed/John Cale
=============================


        Friends have said to lock the door
        and have an open house no more
        they said the Factory must change
        And slowly slip away

        But if I have to live in fear
        where will I get my ideas
        with all those crazy people gone
        Will I slowly slip away

        Still there's no more Billy Name
        Ondine is not the same
        Wonton and the Turtle gone
        Slowly slip away
        slowly slip away

        If I close the Factory door
        and don't see those people anymore
        if I give in to infamy
        I'll slowly slip away

        I know it seems that friends are right
        hello daylight, goodbye night
        but starlight is so quiet here
        Think I'll slowly slip away

        What can I do by myself
        it's good to here from someone else
        it's good to hear a crazy voice
        Will not slip away
        will not slip away

        If I have to live in fear
        my ideas will slowly slip away

        If I have to live in fear
        I'm afraid my life will slip away

        If you can't see me past my door
        why your thoughts could slowly slip away

        If I have to lock the door
        another life exists no more slip away

        Friends have said to lock the door
        watch out for what comes through the door
        they said the Factory must change

        But I don't

"Smalltown"
=============================
album _Songs For Drella_
(Lou Reed/John Cale, 1990)

written by Lou Reed/John Cale
=============================


        When you're growing up in a small town
        when you're growing up in a small town
        when you're growing up in a small town
        you say no one famous ever came from here

        When you're growing up in a small town
        and you're having a nervous breakdown
        and you think that you'll never escape it
        yourself or the place that you live

        Where did Picasso come from
        there's no Michelangelo coming from Pittsburgh
        if art is the tip of the iceberg
        I'm the part sinking below

        When you're growing up in a small town
        bad skin, bad eyes, gay and fatty
        people look at you funny
        when you're in a small town

        My father worked in construction
        it's not something for which I'm suited
        oh, what is something for which you are suited?
        getting out of here

        I hate being odd in a small town
        if they stare let them stare in New York City
        at this pink-eyed painting albino
        how far can my fantasy go?

        I'm no Dali coming from Pittsburgh
        no adorable lisping Capote
        my hero, oh do you think I could meet him?
        I'd camp out at his front door

        There's only one good thing about a small town
        there's only one good use for a small town
        there's only one good thing about a small town
        you know that you want to get out

        When you're growing up in a small town
        you know you'll grow down in a small town
        there's only one good use for a small town

        You hate it and you'll know you have to leave

The Wiltern, Los Angeles
========================


        When you're growing up in a small town
        when you're growing up in a small town
        when you're growing up in a small town
        you say no one famous ever came from here

        When you're growing up in a small town
        and you're having a nervous breakdown
        you think that you'll never escape it
        yourself or the place that you live, ah

        Where did Picasso come from
        no Michelangelo is coming from Pittsburgh
        if art is the tip of the iceberg
        I'm the part sinking below

        Well, Michael Rathke
        that's Mike Rathke
        Michael, you're a guitar player
        that's a piano
        is that you doing that?
        would you stand up?
        now
        is that really you playing that man?
        prove it

        Okay
        you know Fernando is playing a bass that looks like a bass
        you're playing a guitar that sounds like piano
        so I point you nobody is playing it off stage
        so we don't have any tapes off stage
        we don't have any loops off stage
        every fucking note you hear is us
        right in front of you
        you get it?
        live, we're live
        not note up my sleeve baby we don't have any

        When you're growing up in a small town
        bad skin, bad eyes, gay and fatty
        you know gay and fatty, people look at you funny
        when you're in a small town

        You know my, my ........ worked in construction
        it's not something for which I was ..... suited, oh yeah
        oh yeah, so what's something for which you are suited?
        get fuck out of here

        Oh yeah

        You know I hate being odd in a small town
        if they stare let them stare in New York City
        at this pink-eyed painting albino
        how far can my fantasy go?

        I, I'm no Dali coming from Pittsburgh
        no adorable lisping Capote, oh my hero
        oh my hero, do you think I could meet him, baby?
        hung out at his front door

        There's only one good thing about a small town
        there's only one good thing about a small town
        there's only one good thing about a small town
        you know that you want to get out

        When, when, when you're growing up in a small town
        you know you'll grow down in a small town
        there's only one good use for a small town

        You know as we traveled across the united states
        we're taking a survey
        depending on when we're playing
        I can wonder your opinion about that except
        I think you're from New York as the first place
        so I mean so there's almost no point right
        but just, just to complete my survey
        which will be published in the biblical quarterly
        you know at Washington
        so, ah, do you think this is a smalltown?
        yes?
        and, no?
        woh, there you go
        nice to know that's somebody from long island here
        who'd drink the water

        You'll know you gotta leave
        you'll know you gotta leave
        you'll know you gotta leave
        leave the small town

        You'll know you gotta leave
        you'll know you gotta leave
        you'll know you gotta leave

        Leave the small town

        leave the small town
        leave the small town

"Smiles"
===================================
album _Growing Up In Public_
(Lou Reed, 1980)

written by Lou Reed/Michael Fonfara
===================================


        Smiles, I was taught never to smile
        I was told the stylish smiles of buffoonery
        chicanery and larceny abound

        My mom said unless someone sticks you right in front of a camera
        a smile is the last thing that you wanna do
        Those smiles, those mirthless toothy smiles

        Smiles, they all smile on TV
        The quizmaster with his withered crones
        the talkshow hosting movie stars, the politician licking feet

        The mugger, the rapist, the arsonic lover
        all smile out from the news, at one time or another
        Those smiles, those garish sickly smiles

        When I was young my mother said to me
        never, ever, let anyone see that you're happy

        Smiles, never, ever let them see you smile
        they'll always put you down
        With those smiles, never, ever let them see you smile
        they'll always put you down
        With your smiles, never, ever let them see you smile
        don't you know they'll make you go

        Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo

Smiles

Smiles - I was taught never to smile
I was told the stylish smiles of buffoonery
chicanery and larcemy abound
My man said unless someone sticks you right in front of a camera
A smile is the last thing that you wanna do
Those smiles - those mirthless toothy smiles

Smiles - they all smile on T.V.
the quizmaster with his withered crones
The talk show hosting moviestars
the politician licking feet
The mugger, the rapist,
The arsonist lover
All smile out from the news
At one time or another
Those smiles - those garish, sickly smiles

When I was young my mother said to me -
"Never, ever, let anyone see that you're happy"
Smiles, never, ever let them see you smile -
They'll always put you down - with your smiles -
never, ever, let them see you smile -
Don't you know, they'll make you go:
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo

"So Alone"
===================================
album _Growing Up In Public_
(Lou Reed, 1980)

written by Lou Reed/Michael Fonfara
===================================


        She calls on the phone
        she says she doesn't want to be alone
        She says it's making her neurotic
        but please don't mistake it for being erotic

        So alone, so all alone

        She says let's go for a walk
        we'll have a drink and maybe we will talk
        And he thinks she has possibilities
        if she could just put away her rosary

        So alone, nobody wants to be alone

        But I just didn't know
        I swear to you, I just didn't know
        I would never make you sad
        if I had known I never would have
        said those things to you
        you have to be crazy to say those things to you

        Let's face it I made a mistake
        well you know, fools rush in where angels take a break
        I can't be smart all of the time
        and anyway I didn't know you were making time over him

        To tell you the truth, I forget all about him

        And you know, I don't think it's nice
        asking one man about another man's vice
        I don't care if you pick my head
        as long as we end up in bed

        Alone, just the two of us alone

        I just didn't know
        I swear to God, I just didn't know
        Can't you understand that it's frightening
        when you hear women talking about castrating and hating men
        who wants to know about how you hate men

        Well, you said now you wanted to dance
        so now we're going to dance
        You said that you weren't complete
        but we're going to put you on your feet
        You said that you were very vexed
        you told me to forget about sex
        You said you liked me for my mind
        well, I really love your behind

        Oh, get up and boogie, oh baby, get up and dance
        Oh, get, get, get, get up and boogie, baby, oh, get up and dance
        Shake your booty, mama, oh, get up and dance

        Your points very clear
        you're not one to cry into your beer
        Why don't we go to my place
        believe me, I'm very chaste

        And I'm so alone, ao all alone

        Sure all men are beasts
        hey, look, I'll sit here quietly and I'll stare at my feet
        I don't blame you for taking umbrage
        with animals staring at your cleavage

        So alone, we're so all alone

        Hey, do you mind if I turn out the light
        don't take offense, but why don't you spend the night
        I know your passions run very deep
        but at this point we both need sleep

        So alone, and who wants to be alone

So Alone

She calls on the people
She says she doesn't want to be alone
She says it's making her neurotic
But please don't mistake it for being erotic
So alone, so all alone

She says let's go for a walk
We'll have a drink and maybe we will talk
And he thinks she has possibilities
If she could just put away her rosary -
So alone -
Nobody wants to be alone

        Walked down in your house last night
        see if you were home
        Found out that you'd gone out
        and I was all alone

        So blue, (so blue) so blue (so blue)
        I'm always cryin' over you
        (So blue, so blue) so

        Why hadn't I been true

        Sometime when days are gone
        and memories have past
        I will recall our love
        one that didn't last

Walk down to your house last night
See if you were home
Find out that you've gonne out
And I was all alone
So blue
I'm always cryin' over you

Went to the candy store
But you weren't there
Somehow I do it out

(and it is all I am able rewrite for now)

i have noticed your lyrics for so blue are a bit patchy
here is my own ears version taken from the Rockin on Broadway album



So Blue
(the jades 1958)

Walked down your house last night,
See if you were home,
Found out that you'd gone out,
And I was all alone,

So blue (so blue), So blue (so blue),
I'm always crying over you (crying over you),

Went to the candy store,
But you weren't there,
Somehow i knew deep down,
That you weren't there,

So blue (so blue), So blue (so blue),
I'm always crying over you (so blue),

Why did I have to go and stop, your love,
Why hadn't I been true, and all attentive to you?,

Sometime when days are gone,
And memories have past,
I will recall our love,
One that didnt last,

So blue (so blue), So blue (so blue),
I'm always crying over you (so blue),

(So blue) (so blue),
(So blue) (so blue),
(So blue) (so blue),

I will recall our love,
One that didn't last,

So blue (so blue), So blue (so blue),
I'm always crying over you (so blue),

So blue (so blue),---------------------------------/ repeat and fade
I'm always crying over you (so blue),-------------/ two lines

        We used to have good times together
        But now I feel them slip away

        It makes me cry to see love die
        So sad to watch good love go bad

        Remember how you used to feel, dear
        You said nothing could change your mind

        It breaks my heart to see us part
        So sad to watch good love go bad

        Is it any wonder (that I feel so blue)
        When I know for certain that I'm losing you

        Remember how you used to feel, dear
        You said nothing could change your mind

        It breaks my heart to see us part
        So sad to watch good love go bad

        So sad to watch good love go bad

"Some Kinda Love"
(closet mix)
==============================
album _The Velvet Underground_
(The Velvet Underground, 1969)

box set _Peel Slowly And See_
(The Velvet Underground, 1995)

written by Lou Reed
==============================


        Some kinds of love
        ah, Marguerita told Tom
        Between thought and expression
        lies a lifetime
        Situations arise
        because of the weather
        And no kinds of love
        are better than others

        Some kinds of love
        ah, Marguerita told Tom
        Like a dirty French novel, ooohhh
        the absurd courts the vulgar
        And some kinds of love
        the possibilities are endless
        And for me to miss one
        would seem to be groundless
        mmmm.. la-dee-ta-ta-ta

        I heard what you said
        ah, Marguerita heard Tom
        And of course you're a bore
        but in that you're not charmless
        For a bore what is a straight line, ah
        that finds a wealth in division
        And some kinds of love, ooohhh
        are mistaken for vision
        la-dee-ta-ta-ta, ooohhh yeah

        Mmmm.. put jelly on your shoulder
        let us do what you fear most
        That from which you recoil, ooohhh
        but which still makes your eyes moist
        Ooohhh, put jelly on your shoulder
        lie down upon the carpet
        Between thought and expression
        let us now kiss the culprit
        mmmm.. la-la-ta-ta

        I don't know just what it's all about
        Ooohhh, put on your red pajamas and find out
        Mmmm.. oh, la-dee-ta-ta-ta
        Mmmm.. la-dee-ta-ta-ta
        Mmmm..

        Between thought and expression
        lies a lifetime
        Situations arise
        because of the weather
        And no kinds of love
        are better than others

        Some kinds of love
        now Marguerita told Tom
        Like a dirty French novel
        the absurd courts the vulgar
        And baby, some kinds of love
        the possibilities are endless
        And for me to miss one
        would seem to be groundless

        Well I heard what you said
        Marguerita heard Tom
        And of course you're a bore
        but in that you're not charmless
        Because a bore is a straight line
        that finds a wealth in division
        Some kinds of love
        are mistaken for vision, woh
        la-dee-ta-ta-ta

        Put jelly on your shoulder
        hey babe, lie down upon the carpet
        Let us do what you fear most
        but which still makes your eyes moist
        Woh, put jelly on your shoulder, ooohhh
        lie down upon the carpet
        Between thought and expression
        let us now kiss the culprit, wow
        Oh-woh-woh-oh
        la-dee-ta-ta-ta

        Woh, I don't know just what it's all about
        But put on your red pajamas, baby, and find out
        Woh, woh-woh
        la-dee-ta-ta-ta
        Woh-woh-woh-woh

Just a minor correction for the lyrics of "Some Kinda Love".

In the second verse it's
"Like a dirty French novel/Combines the absurd with the vulgar"

and in the third verse it says
"'Cause a bore is a straight liner/That finds a wealth in division".

just thought id throw in a correction or two.
in your lyric transcription
you have used the 'closet' mix of 'Some Kinda Love';
this would be fine for the rest of the album,
but that song is actually a different take,
and the lyrics in the 'clean' Valentin mix
(which is what most people have) are quite different.
Personally I prefer the Valentin version,
but perhaps you should include both the lyrics to the Valentin mix
and the 'closet' mix.
Here are the revised, correct lyrics
for the more common Valentin mix:



Some kinds of love
ah, Margarita told Tom
Between thought and expression
lies a lifetime
Situations arise
because of the weather
And no kinds of love
are better than others

Some kinds of love
Margarita told Tom
Like a dirty French novel
Combines the absurd with the vulgar
In some kinds of love
the possibilities are endless
And for me to miss one
would seem to be groundless

I heard what you said
ah, Margarita heard Tom
And of course you're a bore
but in that you're not charmless
'Cos a bore what is a straight liner
that finds a wealth in division
And some kinds of love, ooohhh
are mistaken for vision
la-dee-ta-ta-ta, ooohhh, all right

Put jelly on your shoulder
let us do what you fear most
That from which you recoil
but which still makes your eyes moist
Put jelly on your shoulder baby
lie down upon the carpet
Between thought and expression, uh
let us now kiss the culprit, move it on

I don't know just what it's all about
(I'll tell you something)
But put on your red pajamas and find out
Mmm, mmm, mmm
(Oooh, put it on
Long long time)

"Some Kind Of Nature"
==================================
album _Plastic Beach_
(Gorillaz, 2010)

written by Gorillaz/Lou Reed

Lou Reed: vocal, additional guitar
==================================


        Some kind of nature, some kind of soul
        some kind of mixture, some kind of goal
        Some kind of majesty, some chemical load-load

        Some kind of metal made up from glue
        some kind of plastic I could wrap around you
        The needy eat man mades they wear phony clothes
        they sit with barbiturates
        until they grow old-old-old-old-old

        Some kind of nature, some kind of soul
        some kind of mixture, some kind of goal
        Some kind of majesty, some chemical load-load

        While me I love plastics and digital foils
        to wrap up the sound and protect the girls
        From the spiritual poison we expel at night
        like phony clothes but I really like might

        Some kind of nature
        some kind of nature, some kind of soul
        Come forth within us
        Oh lord forgive me
        some kind of mixture, some kind of goal
        It's gonna come and find us
        all we are is stars

        Some kind of metal made up from glue
        some kind of plastic I could wrap around you
        The needy eat man mades they wear phony clothes
        they sit with barbiturates
        until they grow old-old-old-old-old

        Some kind of nature
        some kind of nature, some kind of soul
        Come forth within us
        Oh lord forgive me
        some kind of mixture, some kind of goal
        It's gonna come and find us
        all we are is stars

"Something Happened"
===========================
album _Permanent Record_
(Original Soundtrack, 1988)

written by Lou Reed
===========================


        Something happened
        I just don't understand
        Something happened
        It's making me feel mad

        Something happened you don't hear about
        at least I never did before

        Something happened
        I just don't understand
        Something happened
        I just don't understand
        Something happened
        It's making me feel mad, oh

        I never saw this on TV
        I never read it in no book
        ah

        Something happened
        I just don't understand
        hey baby, something happened

        I just don't understand
        something happened
        I just don't understand
        something happened
        I just don't understand
        something happened
        I just don't understand
        something happened

        Something happened
        I just don't understand
        Something happened
        It's making me feel mad

        I thought I knew a lot of things
        but I don't know a thing at all

        Something happened
        I just don't understand
        The things I hear and see
        don't seem the same
        The things I touch and feel
        are forever changed

        I've never felt this way before
        and I hope I never do again

        Something happened
        I don't know why or when
        oh, something happened

        I just don't understand
        something happened
        I just don't understand

        Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
        something happened
        Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
        something happened
        Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
        something happened
        Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

These are the lyrics for Something Happened.
It's my personal transcription
but i think it's all right (more or less, hehe).


"Something Happened"

Something happened
I just don't understand
Something happened
It's making me feel mad
Something happened
You don't hear about
Oh, please that never did before
Something happened...

Something happened
It's making me feel mad
I never saw this on tv
I never read it in no book
It's Something happened...

Something happened
It's making me feel mad
I thought I knew a lot of things
But I don't know a thing, oh, oh, oh
Something happened
I just don't understand
The things I hear 'n' see   (I'm not very sure of the " 'n' ")
Don't seem the same
The things I touch 'n' feel
Are forever changed
I've never felt this way before
and  I hope I never do again
Something happened...


*I don't know if these are exactly the lyrics but, i think so.

These are the lyrics for "Something" again,
i think now they're completed.



"Something Happened"   (More completed)

Something happened
I just don't understand
Something happened
It's making me feel mad
Something happened
You don't hear about
Oh, please that never did before
Something happened...

Something happened
It's making me feel mad
I never saw this on tv

Are forever changed
I've never felt this way before
and  I hope I never do again
Something happened...
I don't what or when (this is the new line)
Something happened...

written by Lou Reed
===================


        If there's rage inside you so you cannot think
        spit it out
        If you get so angry that you cannot speak
        spit it out
        Talk to him or her or it
        and tell them where they can put it
        Spit it out, spit it out
        You got to talk to him or her or it
        and take aim with your mouth and spit
        Spit it out, spit it out

        If you get worked over at your job
        spit it out
        If a taxi almost runs you down
        spit it out
        You got to take aim with your mouth and speak
        and give it to them right between the teeth
        Spit it out, spit it out
        Talk to him or her or it
        and take aim with your mouth and spit
        Spit it out, spit it out

        Spit it out
        Hey, hey, hey

        If you're patient and you have the time
        spit it out
        Wait till they're on the decline
        spit it out
        The Chinese say you meet the hard with the soft
        the Yin with the Yang, the down with the up, oh
        Spit it out, spit it out
        You got to grab that dumb he, she or it
        and give it to them right between the teeth
        Spit it out, spit it out

"Starlight"
=============================
album _Songs For Drella_
(Lou Reed/John Cale, 1990)

written by Lou Reed/John Cale
=============================


        Starlight open wide
        starlight open up you door
        This is New York calling
        with movies from the street
        Movies with real people
        what you get is what you see
        Starlight open wide
        Andy's Cecil B. DeMille

        Come on L.A. give us a call
        We've got superstars who talk
        they'll do anything at all
        Ingrid, Viva, Little Joe
        Baby Jane, and Eddie S.
        But you'd better call us soon
        before we talk ourselves to death

        Starlight open wide
        everybody is a star
        Split-screen eight hour movies
        we've got color, we've got sound
        Won't you recognize us
        we're everything you hate
        Andy loves old Hollywood movies
        he'll scare you hypocrites to death

        You know that shooting up's for real
        That person who's screaming
        that's the way he really feels
        We're all improvising
        five movies in a week
        If Hollywood doesn't call us
        we'll be sick

        Starlight open wide
        do to movies what you did to art
        Can you see beauty in ugliness
        or is it playing in the dirt
        There are stars out on the New York streets
        we wanna capture them on film
        But if no one wants to see 'em
        we'll make another and another

        Starlight let us in that magic room
        We've all dreamt of Hollywood
        it can't happen too soon
        Won't you give us a million dollars the rent's due
        Andy will give you two movies and a painting
        starlight open wide

stephanie says' second chord is Em(onB) I think;
that way the descent is smoother,
and I seem to hear it in the guitar as well.
However, in the second part of the chorus (Why she's giving...)
it does seem like a basic Em to me.
I've tried it in sibelius,
with an artificial bass line to emphasize the lower guitar string
and it kinda fits (ps: the attached midi file isn't finished,
and I've cut out the lead vocals;
I've added a F-G bass under the last F-chord of the verse,
but I don't think the velvets do it themselves).
I finally managed to figure out
most of john cale's viola part though - simply lovely.
[The marimba part (or whatever)
is as good as impossible to figure out I'm afraid,
though I've added the 'caroline says' ending at the back.]
Once it's finished, I'll send you some kind of transcript
(I don't play any violin or the like however,
so I'm not sure how to write it down without using notes...).

"Strawman"
===================
album _New York_
(Lou Reed, 1989)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        We who have so much to you who have so little
        to you who don't have anything at all
        We who have so much more than any one man does need
        and you who don't have anything at all, ah
        Does anybody need another million dollar movie
        does anybody need another million dollar star
        Does anybody need to be told over and over
        spitting in the wind comes back at you twice as hard

        Strawman, going straight to the devil
        strawman, going straight to hell
        Strawman, going straight to the devil

        Strawman
        strawman
        Strawman
        strawman, yes

        Does anyone really need a billion dollar rocket
        does anyone need a 60,000 dollars car
        Does anyone need another president
        or the sins of Swaggart parts 6, 7, 8 and 9, ah
        Does anyone need yet another politician
        caught with his pants down and money sticking in his hole
        Does anyone need another racist preacher
        spittin' in the wind can only do you harm, ooohhh

        Strawman, going straight to the devil
        strawman, going straight to hell
        Strawman, going straight to the devil

        Strawman
        strawman
        Strawman
        strawman

        Does anyone need another faulty shuttle
        blasting off to the moon, Venus or Mars
        Does anybody need another self-righteous rock singer
        whose nose he says has led him straight to God
        Does anyone need yet another blank skyscraper
        if you're like me I'm sure a minor miracle will do
        A flaming sword or maybe a gold ark floating up the Hudson
        when you spit in the wind it comes right back at you

        Strawman, going straight to the devil
        Strawman, going straight to hell
        Strawman, going to the devil

        Strawman, strawman

"Street Hassle"
=====================
album _Street Hassle_
(Lou Reed, 1978)

written by Lou Reed
=====================


        a) Waltzing Matilda

        Waltzing Matilda whipped out her wallet
        the sexy boy smiled in dismay
        She took out four twenties 'cause she liked round figures
        everybody's queen for a day
        Oh babe, I'm on fire and you know I admire your body
        why don't we slip away
        Although I'm sure you're certain it's a rarity me flirtin'
        sha-la-la-la, this way

        Oh, sha-la-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la-la
        hey baby, come on let's slip away

        Luscious and gorgeous, oh what a happy muscle
        call out the National Guard
        She creamed in her jeans as he picked up her means
        from off of the formica topped bar
        And cascading slowly, he lifted her wholly
        and boldly out of this world
        And despite people's derision
        proved to be more than a diversion
        sha-la-la-la, later on

        And then sha-la-la-la-la, he entered her slowly
        and showed her where he was coming from
        And then sha-la-la-la-la, he made love to her gently
        it was like she'd never ever come
        And then sha-la-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la-la
        when the sun rose and he made to leave
        You know, sha-la-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la-la
        neither one regretted a thing


        b) Street Hassle

        Hey, that cunt's not breathing
        I think she's had too much
        of something or other, hey man, you know what I mean
        I don't mean to scare you
        but you're the one who came here
        and you're the one who's gotta take her when you leave
        I'm not being smart
        or trying to be cold on my part
        and I'm not gonna wear my heart on my sleeve
        But you know people get all emotional
        and sometimes, man, they just don't act rational
        then you know they think they're just on TV

        Sha-la-la-la-la, man
        why don't you just slip away

        You know I'm glad that we met, man
        it really was nice talking
        and I really wish that there was a little more time to speak
        But you know it could be a hassle
        trying to explain myself to a police officer
        about how it was your old lady got herself stiffed
        And it's not like we could help her
        there was nothing no one could do
        and if there was, man, you know I would have been the first
        But when someone turns that blue
        it is a universal truth
        then you just know that bitch will never fuck again
        By the way, that's really some bad shit
        that you came to our place with
        but you ought to be more careful around the little girls
        It's either the best or it's the worst
        and since I don't have to choose I guess I won't
        and I know this ain't no way to treat a guest
        But why don't you grab your old lady by the feet
        and just lay her out on the darkened street
        and by morning, she's just another hit and run
        You know some people got no choice
        and they can't never find a voice
        to talk with that they can even call their own
        So the first thing that they see
        that allows them the right to be
        why they follow it, you know it's called bad luck


        c) Slipaway

        Wait, man, that's just a lie
        it's a lie she tells her friends
        there's a real song, a real song
        that she wouldn't even admit to herself
        Bleeding in her heart, it's a song lots of people moan
        it's a painful song
        with a lot of sad truths
        and life's full of sad songs
        a penny for a wish
        and wishing won't make it so Joe
        Where pretty kiss, where a pretty face
        can't have its way
        Though tramps like us who were born to play

        Love has gone away
        and there's no one here now
        And there's nothing left to say
        but oh how I miss him, baby
        Ah baby, come on and slip away
        come on baby, why don't you slip away

        Love has gone away
        took the rings off my fingers
        And there's nothing left to say
        but oh how, oh how I need it, baby
        Come on baby, I need you baby
        oh please don't slip away
        I need your loving so bad, babe
        please don't slip away

========================


        So I wanna tell you a little bit
        about this song called Street Hassle
        I wanted to write a song that had
        a great model act set to rock
        something that could've been written by
        William Burroughs, Hubert Selby, John Reechy
        Tennesse Williams, Nelson Algren
        maybe a little Raymond Chandler
        you mix it all up and you have Street Hassle

        Waltzing Matilda whipped out her wallet
        the sexy boy smiled in dismay
        Took out four twenties 'cause she liked round figures
        everybody's queen for a day
        Oh baby, I'm on fire
        don't you know I admire your body
        why don't we slip away
        Although I'm sure you're certain
        it's a rarity me flirtin'
        sha-la-la-la, that way

        Sha-la-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la-la
        hey babe, why don't we slip away

        Luscious and lovely, oh what a hunk of muscle
        why don't you call out the National Guard
        She creamed in her jeans as he picked up her means
        from off of the formica topped bar
        And cascading slowly, he lifted her wholly
        and boldly out of this world
        Despite people's derision
        he proved to be more than a diversion
        and then sha-la-la-la-la, later on

        Said, sha-la-la-la-la, he entered her slowly
        and he showed her where he was coming from
        And then sha-la-la-la-la, he made love to her gently
        it was like she'd never ever come
        Then sha-la-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la-la
        when the sun rose and he made to leave
        Sha-la-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la-la
        neither one regretted a thing


        That cunt's not breathing, baby
        I think she's had too much
        something or other, you know what I mean
        I don't mean to scare you
        but you're the one who came here
        but who's gotta get her out here when you leave
        I'm not being smart
        or trying to be cold on my part
        and I'm not gonna wear my heart on my sleeve
        But you know people get all emotional
        and they just don't act rational
        they think they're on TV

        Sha-la-la-la-la, Sha-la-la-la-la
        hey hey, why don't we slip away

        You know I'm really glad that we met, man
        I'm really glad that we've got talking
        really wish that there was a little more time
        that we could speak
        But it could turn into some kind of hassle
        you got to explain to a cop
        how it was your old lady got stiffed
        And it's not like there was something someone could do
        somebody could help her and if there was, baby
        I would have been the first
        But you know it's a universal truth
        somebody turns that blue
        you know that bitch will never fuck again
        So grab your old lady by the feet
        to take her out to the darkened street
        tomorrow morning, she's just another hit and run
        Hit and run, hit and run
        hit and run

        Some people are got no choice
        they can't even find a voice
        to talk with they can call their own
        So the first thing that they see
        takes them the right to be
        what they go ahead and follow it
        you know what that's called bad luck

        Sha-la-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la-la
        sha-la-la-la-la-la
        Sha-la-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la-la
        sha-la-la-la-la-la
        Sha-la-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la-la
        sha-la-la-la-la-la
        Sha-la-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la-la
        sha-la-la-la-la-la

I'm sending you revised lyrics.


'Street Hassle'

a. Waltzing Matilda

Waltzing Matilda whipped out her wallet
sexy boys smiled in dismay
She took out four twenties 'cause she liked round figures
everybody's a queen for a day
.........
She creamed in her jeans as he picked up her means
.........

b. Street Hassle

Hey, that cunt's not breathing, I think she's had too much
..........
I'm not being smart or trying to be cold on my part
..........
But you know people get all emotional
and sometimes, man they just don't act rational
..........


c. Slip Away

Believe me, that's just a lie
that's what she tells her friends
there's a real song, the real song
she won't even admit it to herself
Narrow heart, the song let's the people know
it's a painful song
It'll only say the truth
it lasts for sad songs
twenty for wish
wish it won't make it so
A pretty kiss and a pretty face
can't have it's way
There're tramps like us who were born to pay

Love has gone away
and there's no one here now
And there's nothing left to say
but, oh, how I miss him, baby
Oh, baby, come on and slip away
come on, baby
why don't you slip away

Love has gone away
took the rings of my fingers
And there's nothing left to say
but, oh how, oh how I need you, baby
Come on, baby, I need you baby
oh, please don't slip away
I need your loving so bad, babe
please don't slip away

"Street Hassle"


a. Waltzing Matilda


Waltzing Matilda she whipped out her wallet
And the sexy boys smiled in dismay
She whipped out four twenties, 'cause she liked brown figures
Don't you know that everybody's fucking queer for a day
Babe, don't you know how much I'm on fire
and your body I fucking admire man
Why don't we just fucking go and slip away, hey
I know you're certain, it's a rarity me flirtin'
You know she-la-la-la this way, hey

Oh, sha-la-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la-la
Hey, baby, come on, let's slip away
Let's walk the middle way

Luscious and lovely, hey what a fucking hunk of muscle
Why don't you hey go and call out the National Guard man
Hey she creamed in her jeans as he picked up her knees
From off of the formica topped board
And cascading slowly, man he just he lifted her body wholly
Oh wholly out of this world
And despite people's derision proved to be more than diversion
And then hey
Sha-la-la-la, later on she says

And then sha-la-la-la-la, as he entered her slowly
And showed her where he was coming from
And then sha-la-la-la-la
Hahaha
It was like she never ever come
And then sha-la-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la-la
And later when the sun set and he made her leave
See baby
Hey man neither one fucking regretted a thing

Oh whoa

That was beautiful
That was beautiful

...
Why don't you slip away
Oh baby ooh baby
Slip away


b. Street Hassle


Hey, you know man that chick
that bee you know I think she had too much
Of somebody you know what I mean
Hey I don't mean to scare you,
but you're the one who came here right
So you're the one gotta take her when you leave
Hey look man I'm not trying to be smart be cold...
And I'm not gonna wear my heart on my sleeve
Hey look man people get emotional and don't act rational
They think they're on TV

Hey look it was really nice meeting
It was really nice talking
And I really wish we had a little more we could meet

But you know it could turn into some kind of a hassle
Trying to explain to a fucking police officer
How your old lady got her ass stiffed

Hey look man there's nobody could help
And there's nobody could do a thing
And if there was I would be fucking first man

Look somebody turns that blue
It's fucking universal truth man
That chick ain't gonna fuck again

Hey look man by the way, that's some bad shit
That you came our place with
Maybe you ought to be a little more careful
around these little girls

Hey look man it's either best or it's the fucking worst
I don't gotta choose so I won't
And I know, this is no way to treat a guest
But why don't you grab your old lady by the feet

You go drag her out to the darkest street
Tomorrow morning man she's just another hit and run

Hey look man some people don't have a choice
They don't even have a voice they can talk with
Just call their own

So the first thing they see allows them the right to be
They go ahead and they follow it what else do they want
You know, what it's called
Bad luck


c. Slip Away


Love has gone away
And there's no one here now
And there's nothing left to say
Oh, how I miss him, baby
Oh, baby, come on and slip away
Come on, baby
Why don't you slip away

Love has gone away
Took the rings right of my fingers
And there's nothing left to say
But, oh how, oh how I need you, baby
Come on, baby, I need you baby
Oh, please don't slip away
I need your loving so bad, babe
Please don't slip away

Slip away

_Animal Serenade_ talking part:

so i wanna tell you a little bit
about this song called street hassle.
i wanted to write a song that had a great model act set to rock.
something that could've been written by
william burroughs, hubert selby, john reechy,
tennesse williams, nelson grant?
maybe a little raymond chandler,
you mix it all up and you have street hassle.

This song played by e.piano.
If you wanna play by guitar instead of by piano,
all the strings downtuned a whole-tone
then play like this:




* all the strings downtuned a whole-tone

 1d ----- * downtuned a whole-tone (from e to d)
 2A ----- * downtuned a whole-tone (from B to A)

"Style It Takes"
=============================
album _Songs For Drella_
(Lou Reed/John Cale, 1990)

written by Lou Reed/John Cale

sung by John Cale
=============================


        You've got the money, I've got the time
        you want your freedom, make your freedom mine
        'Cause I've got the style it takes
        and money is all that it takes

        You've got connections and I've got the art
        you like attention and I like your looks
        And I have the style it takes
        and you know the people it takes

        Why don't you sit right over there
        we'll do a movie portrait
        I'll turn the camera on
        and I won't even be there
        a portrait that moves, you look great I think

        I'll put the Empire State Building on your wall
        for 24 hours glowing on your wall
        Watch the sun rise above it in your room
        wallpaper art, a great view

        I've got a Brillo box and I say it's art
        it's the same one you can buy at any supermarket
        'Cause I've got the style it takes
        and you've got the people it takes

        This is a rock group called The Velvet Underground
        I show movies on them, do you like their sound
        'Cause they have a style that grates
        and I have art to make

        Let's do a movie here next week
        We don't have sound but you're so great
        you don't have to speak

        You've got the style it takes, kiss
        you've got the style it takes, eat
        You've got the style it takes, couch
        you've got the style it takes, kiss

        We're rockers and rappers united and strong
        we're here to talk about South Africa
        we don't like what's going on
        It's time for some justice, it's time for the truth
        we've realized
        there's only one thing we can do

        We gotta say, I, I, I
        I ain't gonna play Sun City
        I, I, woh, I
        I ain't gonna play Sun City
        Everybody say, I, I, I
        I ain't gonna play Sun City

        Relocation to phony homelands
        separation of families I can't understand
        23 million can't vote because they're black

        I ain't gonna play Sun City
        I, I, I
        I ain't gonna play Sun City

        Our government tell us we're doing all we can
        constructive engagement is Ronald Reagan's plan
        Meanwhile people are dying and giving up hope
        this quiet diplomacy ain't nothing but a joke

"Sunday Morning"
=======================================
album _The Velvet Underground and Nico_
(The Velvet Underground, 1967)

written by Lou Reed/John Cale
=======================================


        Sunday morning
        brings the dawn in
        It's just a restless feeling
        by my side

        Early dawning
        Sunday morning
        It's just the wasted years
        so close behind

        Watch out, the world's behind you
        there's always someone around you
        Who will call
        it's nothing at all

        Sunday morning
        and I'm falling
        I've got a feeling
        I don't want to know

        Early dawning
        Sunday morning
        It's all the streets you crossed
        not so long ago

        Watch out, the world's behind you
        there's always someone around you
        Who will call
        it's nothing at all

        Watch out, the world's behind you
        there's always someone around you
        Who will call
        it's nothing at all

        Sunday morning
        Sunday morning
        Sunday morning
        Sunday morning
        ...



* all the strings downtuned a whole-tone

 1d ----- * downtuned a whole-tone (from e to d)
 2A ----- * downtuned a whole-tone (from B to A)
 3F ----- * downtuned a whole-tone (from G to F)
 4C ----- * downtuned a whole-tone (from D to C)
 5G ----- * downtuned a whole-tone (from A to G)
 6D ----- * downtuned a whole-tone (from E to D)

note: this song has different pitch from other songs on this album.
tape speed is probably fast... so Lou's voice sounds like female.

        Sunday morning
        brings the dawn in
        It's just a restless feeling
        by my side

        Early dawning
        Sunday morning
        It's just the wasted years
        so close behind

        Watch out, the world's behind you
        there's always someone around you
        Who will call
        it's nothing at all

        Sunday morning
        brings the dawn in
        It's just a restless feeling

I think that the guitar tab for "Sundary Morning"
that I picked up from your site last year
may not be totally correct.
In the line "It's just a restless feeling"
where the bass descends F, E, and D,
I think the chords are actually F, C, Dm instead of F, Em, Dm.
On the C chord, there just happens to be an E in the root.

You say that the speed of the tape in "Sunday Morning" might be off,
but according to Victor Bockris' book
"Transformer: the Lou Reed Story,"
the song was recorded well after the rest of the album
(in the year between recording and release)
as a promotional single and Mr. Reed purposely sang it feminine
because it was a Nico song and he didn't want her on the single.

I might be wrong, and with all respect for Kevin Murphy,
but I think the descending sequence in sunday morning is neither
what was originally there, nor what he suggests.
I think it's rather {F/Am(onE)}{Dm} (downtuned {G/Bm(onF#)}{Em});
that way it descends more natural (at least on piano).
In any case, when you count the vocal line in,
it's that one, since the voice stays on the A,
while the chords descend,
and you can never have this with a C chord,
unless it's with an added 6th,
but then the notation becomes too complicated.

"Sweet Sister Ray"
==============================
unreleased live
(The Velvet Underground, 1968)

written by ?

Apr 1968
La Cave, Cleveland, Ohio
==============================


        Sweet Sister Ray went
        where a movie was goin' around
        It was the biggest movie
        that had ever come to town

        Why this is the biggest movie
        I ever seen in my whole day
        I've never seen a stranger sketch
        anyway

        Why I must be dead because
        I never felt this way alive
        At least I never felt this well
        since nineteen fifty five

        Just then Sister Ray felt
        a hand upon her knee
        "Hey, I'm the crippled orphan
        and I come here constantly"

        Why this is just like a mental hospital
        doors don't have any locks
        Just then in came the doctor
        and he's givin' us electro shock

        Ah, the vaseline on your forehead
        makes you feel so nice
        My hair stood up on end
        and I thought I'd been frozen in ice

        Ah, the room is so pretty
        purple curtains 'n' all
        No one knew that you're crazy
        unless you told them

        Just then I saw
        a hole in the ground
        And I jumped right in
        'cause there wasn't nobody around

"Sword Of Damocles - Externally"
================================
album _Magic And Loss_
(Lou Reed, 1992)

written by Lou Reed
================================


        I see the Sword of Damocles
        is right above your head
        They're trying a new treatment
        to get you out of bed
        But radiation kills both bad and good
        it can not differentiate
        So to cure you they must kill you
        The Sword of Damocles hangs above your head

        Now I've seen lots of people die
        from car crashes or drugs
        Last night on 33rd Street
        I saw a kid get hit by a bus
        But this drawn out torture over which part of you lives
        is very hard to take
        To cure you they must kill you
        The Sword of Damocles above your head

        That mix of morphine and dexedrine
        we use it on the street
        It kills the pain and keeps you up
        your very soul to keep
        But this guessing game has its own rules
        the good don't always win
        And might makes right
        The Sword of Damocles is hanging above your head

        It seems everything's done that must be done
        from over here, though things don't seem fair
        But there are things that we can't know
        maybe there's something over there
        Some other world that we don't know about
        I know you hate that mystic shit
        It's just another way of seeing
        The Sword of Damocles above your head

        I wish I had a talking book
        that told me how to act and look
        A talking book that contained keys
        to past and present memories

        A talking book that said your name
        so if you were gone you'd still remain
        More than a picture on a shelf
        in imagination I could touch

        A talking-talking book

        I wish I had a talking book
        filled with buttons you could push
        Containing looks and sights, your touch
        your feel, your breath, your sounds, your sighs

        How much I'd ask to ask it why
        one must live and one must die

        I wish I had a talking book
        by my side so I could look
        And touch and feel and dream a look
        much bigger than a talking book
        A taste of lovings future and past
        is that so much to really ask
        In this one moment's time and space
        can our love really be replaced
        By a talking book

        Can our love really be replaced
        by a talking book
        Can our love really be replaced
        by a talking book
        Can our love ever, forever be replaced
        Can our love, baby, be replaced

        Can our love ever be replaced
        (can our love really be replaced)
        By a talking book

"Talking Book"
==============================================
from the play _Time Rocker_
(Robert Wilson/Darryl Pinckney/Lou Reed, 1996)

performed by actors, German musicians

Jun 11, 1996
Thalia Theater, Hamburg, Germany
(pre-premiere)
==============================================


        I wish I had a talking book
        taught me how to act and look
        A talking book that contained keys
        to past and present memories

        A talking book that said your name
        so if you were gone you'd still remain
        More than a picture on a shelf
        in imagination I could touch

        A talking-talking book

        I wish I had a talking book
        filled with buttons you could push
        Containing looks and sights, your touch
        your look, your eyes, your scent, your touch
        Your feel, your breath, your sounds, your sighs
        how much I'd live to ask it why
        One must live and one must die

        I wish I had a talking book
        by my side so I could look
        And feel and touch and dream a look
        much bigger than a talking book
        A taste of lovings future and past
        is that so much to really ask
        In this one moment's time and space
        can our love really be replaced
        By a talking book

        Can our love really be replaced
        by a talking book
        Can our love really be replaced
        by a talking book
        Can our love really be replaced
        by a talking book
        Can our love really be replaced
        by a talking book
        Can our love really be replaced
        by a talking book
        Can our love really be replaced
        by a talking book
        Can our love really be replaced
        by a talking book
        Can our love really be replaced
        by a talking book

        Can our love really be replaced
        by a talking book

These are the lyrics for Talking Book.
They're not completed but will be soon!


Talking Book

I wish I had a talking book
That told me how to act and look
A talking book that contains keys
To past and present memories

A t.b that said your name
So if you were gone, you still remain
More than a picture on a shelf
In the imagination I could touch a talking, talking book.

I wish I had a talking book
Filled with buttons you could push
Containing looks and sights
Your touch, your feel, your breath
Your sounds, your sighs
How much I...to ask it why
One must live and one must die
I wish I had a talking book
By my side so I could look
And touch and feel and dream
Ah, look much bigger than a talking book
..........future and past.

Is that so much to really ask?
In this one moment as time and space
How can love really be replaced by a talking book
How can love really be replaced 
How can love really be replaced

How can love ever be replaced by a talking book.

"Tarbelly And Featherfoot"
======================================================
album _Sweet Relief - A Benefit For Victoria Williams_
(Various Artists, 1993)

written by Victoria Williams
======================================================


        Tarbelly stood in the door
        as browsing out
        Body like a statue
        hands high on his hips
        And his mouth, while his mouth
        drooling like a leaky spout
        Looking for something from another day
        a day when she can ask him and he would want to play

        Hey, hey
        Born to play
        hey-hey-hey
        Thumb up, down the stairs, she came
        she heard him coming, she stood there just the same, hey-hey

        Featherfoot walked right past .....
        into the kitchen
        Make .... sandwiches, drunk a pot of coffee
        and a bottle of ...... little cracker
        Cut his toes and his hair and his clothes
        made three phone calls .......

        All the while, Tarbelly stood in the door
        his eyes are browsing out
        Hands high on his hips, body like a statue
        mouth drooling like a leaky spout
        Eyes browsing out, body like a statue
        drooling like a leaky spout

        Now Featherfoot got to thinking he'd like to go out
        and Tarbelly stood in the way
        And he thought, and he thought
        of the game he used to play
        And he used ..... swing the statue
        And took to Tarbelly by the wrists
        and he carried up to New York

        And round and round and round he swang
        and round and round and round he swang
        And round and round he swang, ....... of fly

        Fly-fly away up high
        all of the ...... through
        And when she stopped, no one could say
        you can chase a shadow across the day
        You can chase a shadow across the day
        you can chase a shadow across the day
        you can ..... a love without giving
        get away, giving, giving away

his mouth, while his mouth drooling like a ...

Looking for soemthing from another day,
a day when she can ask him and he would want to play
hey, hey, hey, born to play, hey, hey, hey

Thumb up, thumb up, down the stairs
she came she heard him coming 
she stood there just the same, hey, hey

Feather Tarbelly walked right past...into the kitchen
Make...sandwiches, drunk a...of coffe and a bottle of...vodka
...his toes and his hair and his clothes, made three phone calls...
All the while
Tarbelly stood in the door
His eyes are...out
Hands on his hips, body like a statue
mouth drooling like...
...
and Tarbelly stood in the way
and he thought, and he thought
the game he used to play
and...
and took to Tarbelly by the wrists
and took to Tarbelly to New York
and round and round and round he swang
...of fly
fly, fly, away...
and when she stopped
no one could say...
a shadow acroos the day...
...giving away.

"Tatters"
===================
album _Ecstasy_
(Lou Reed, 2000)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        Some couples live in harmony
        some do not
        Some couples yell and scream
        some do not

        But what you said was something
        that I can't forget
        It echoes in my head
        like a bullet made of lead

        Some people yell and scream
        and some do not
        Some people sacrifice their lives
        and some do not

        Some people wait for sleep
        to take them away
        While others read books endlessly
        hoping problems will go away

        I know you're hoping everything
        works out
        Neither one of us is
        the type who shouts

        You sleep in the bedroom
        while I pace up and down the hall
        Our baby stares at both of us
        wondering which one of us to call

        I guess it's true that not
        every match burns bright
        I guess it's true
        not all that I say is right

        But what you said still bounces
        around in my head
        Who thought this could happen to us
        when we first went to bed

        I'm told in the end
        that none of this matters
        All couples have troubles
        and none of this matters

        But what you said
        still echoes in my head
        And I'm still in the hallway
        downstairs sleeping alone instead

        I know you don't care
        but here's my last thought
        Not that it matters
        but here's the last thing I thought

        Our little thing is lying
        here in tatters
        And you my dear
        don't have any manners

        Sad to leave this way
        to leave it all in tatters
        Saddening to leave this way
        to leave it all in tatters
        I suppose that we all could say
        that nothing of it matters
        Still it's sad
        to see everything in tatters

They are the exact words he sings,
not just lyrics I copied from the booklet.



Tatters
-------

Some couples live in harmony
Some do not
Some couples yell and scream
Some do not
But what you said was something that I can't forget
It echoes in my head like a bullet made of lead

Some people yell and scream and some do not
Some people sacrifice their lives and some do not
Some people wait for sleep to take them away
While others read books endlessly
Hoping problems will go away

I know you're hoping everything works out
Neither one of us is the type who shouts
You sleep in the bedroom
while I pace up and down the hall
Our baby stares at both of us
wondering which one of us to call

I guess it's true that not every match burns bright
I guess it's true not all that I say is right
But what you said still bounces around in my head
Who thought this could happen to us

I'm told in the end that none of this matters
All couples have troubles and none of this matters
But what you said still echoes in my head
And I'm still in the hallway downstairs sleeping alone instead

I know you don't care but here's my last thought
Not that it matters, but here's the last thing I thought
Our little thing is lying here in tatters
and you my dear don't have any manners

Sad to leave this way, to leave it all in tatters
Saddening to leave this way, to leave it all in tatters
I suppose we all could say that nothing of it matters
But still it's sad to see everything in tatters

"Teach The Gifted Children"
===================================
album _Growing Up In Public_
(Lou Reed, 1980)

written by Lou Reed/Michael Fonfara
===================================


        Teach the gifted children
        teach them to have mercy
        Teach them about sunsets
        teach them about moonrise
        Teach them about anger
        the sin that comes with dawning
        Teach them about flowers
        and the beauty of forgetfulness

        Then take me to the river (take me to the river)
        and put me in the water (and put me in the water)
        Bless them and forgive them (take me to the river)
        father cause they just don't know (take me to the river)

        All the gifted children

        Teach the gifted children
        the way of men and animals
        Teach them about cities
        the history of the mysteries
        Their vice and their virtues
        about branches that blow in the wind
        On the wages of their sins
        teach them of forgiveness
        teach them about mercy
        Teach them about music
        and the cool and cleansing waters

        What do they say, take me to the river (take me to the river)
        take me to the river (take me to the river)
        Put me in the water  (take me to the river)
        and teach the gifted children (take me to the river)
        All the gifted children (take me to the river)
        (Take me to the river)
        (Take me to the river)

Maybe it helps.


Teach The Gifted Children

Teach the gifted children
Teach them to have mercy
Teach them about sunsets
Teach them about moonrise
teach them about anger
The sin that comes with drawing
Teach them about flowers
The beauty of forgetfulness
Then take me to the river
And put me in the water
Bless them and forgive them
Father 'cause they just don't know
All the gifted children
Teach the gifted children
The ways of men and animals
Teach them about cities
The history of the mysteries
Their vices and their virtues
About branches that blow in the wind
On the wages of their sins
Teach them of forgiveness
Teach them about mercy
Teach them about music
And the cool and cleansing water
What do they say
Take me to the river
Take me to the river
Put me in the water
And teach the gifted children
All the gifted children

==============================================
album _Soundsville!_
(Various Artists, 1965)

written by
Lou Reed/Terry Philips/Jerry Vance/Jimmie Sims

performed by The Hollywoods
==============================================


        Teardrop in the sand
        Teardrop in the sand

        Who's on that surfboard
        who can it be
        That pretty surfer girl
        who wants love me
        But -

        - I'm all alone
        with no one of my own
        So all alone
        all I have is

        Teardrops in the sand
        Teardrops in the sand

        When we went surfing
        I was so proud
        It felt like lying
        high on a cloud
        But -

        - I'm all alone
        with no one of my own
        So all alone
        all I have is

        Teardrops in the sand
        Teardrops in the sand

        You know, once I was so happy
        I loved the whole world
        and now there's no more fun and surfing
        Without my little, oh, surfer girl
        yes, without her, oh

        I'm all alone
        with no one of my own
        So all alone
        all I have is

        Teardrops in the sand
        Teardrops in the sand

"Teardros in the Sand"


Who's on the surfboard?
Who can it be?
That pretty surfwer girl
Who wants love me

But, i'm all alone
With no one of my own
So all alone
All i have is
Teardrops in the sand
Teardrops in the sand

When we were surfing
I was so proud
...
...
But i'm all alone
With no one of my own
So all alone
All i have is
Teardrops in the sand
Teardrops in the sand

You know once i was so happy
I loved the whole world
And now there's no more fun and surfing 
without my, oh, surfer girl
yes, without her

I'm all alone
With no one of my own
So alone
All i have is
Teardrops in the sand
Teardrops in the sand


---------------------------------------------------------------------

I send you a lyrics update for the pre-velvet songs.
i paid attention and i could fill more gaps,
i could complete some more gaps.


teardrops in the sand

when we were surfing
it felt like crying
high on a cloud...

        Oh-oh, wah-woo, woo
        Oh-oh, wah-woo, woo

        Each time we have a quarrel
        it almost breaks my heart
        'Cause I'm so afraid
        we will have to part

        Each night I ask
        the stars up above
        Why must I be a teenager in love

        One day I feel so happy
        next day I feel so sad
        I guess I'll learn to take
        the good with the bad

        Each night I ask
        the stars up above
        Why must I be a teenager in love

        I cried a tear
        for nobody but you
        I'll be a lonely one
        if you should say we're through

        Well if you want to make me cry
        it won't be so hard to do
        And if you should say goodbye
        I'll go on loving you

        Each night I ask
        the stars up above
        Why must I be a teenager in love

        I cried a tear
        for nobody but you
        I'll be a lonely one
        if you should say we're through

        Well if you want to make me cry
        that won't be so hard to do
        And if you should say goodbye
        I'll go on loving you

        Each night I ask
        the stars up above
        Why must I be a teenager in love

        Why must I be a teenager in love
        Why must I be a teenager in love
        Why must I be a teenager in love
        In love, oh, oh-oh, oh

"Tell It To Your Heart"
=======================
album _Mistrial_
(Lou Reed, 1986)

written by Lou Reed
=======================


        I'm staring through a telescope at night
        at a large light in the sky
        Its spinning lights reminded me of you
        A star spinning in orbit
        lighting up the sky
        Or maybe it was not a star at all

        I'm standing by the Hudson River's edge at night
        looking out across the Jersey shore
        At a neon light spelling out some cola's name
        And I thought your name should be dancing
        beamed from satellites
        Larger than any billboard in Times Square

        Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid
        I'm the one who loves you in each and every way
        Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid
        Ney York City lovers
        Tell it to your heart
        (Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid
        tell it to your heart)
        (Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid
        tell it to your heart)

        I'm up on the roof, it's 5 a.m.
        I guess I couldn't sleep
        And I see this spinning light that I saw last week
        Maybe I should wake you up
        but by then it might be gone
        You never know what you see when you look up in the sky

        I ran outside down a darkened street
        listening to my boot heels click
        My leather jacket squeaked, I needed a cigarette
        When I turned the corner
        my spinning light was in the street
        They were filming a commercial on TV

        Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid
        we're no teenage movie that ends in tragedy
        Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid
        New York City lovers
        Tell it to your heart
        tell it to your heart
        Tell it to your heart
        tell it to your heart
        (Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid
        tell it to your heart)
        (Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid
        tell it to your heart)

        tell it to your heart)

"Tell It To Your Heart"

I was staring through a telescope at night 
at a large light in the sky
its spinning lights reminded me of you
a star spinning in orbit
lighting up the sky
or maybe it was not a star at all

I was standing by the Hudson River's
        edge at night
looking out across the Jersey shore
 at a neon light spelling out some
cola's name
and I thought
your name should be dancing
beamed from satellites
larger than any billboard in Times Square

Tell it to your heart
Please don't be afraid
I'm the one who loves you
In each and every way
Tell it to your heart
Please don't be afraid
N.Y.C lovers
Tell it to your heart

I'm on the roof, it's 5 a.m.
I guess I couldn't sleep
and I see this spinning light that
I saw last week
Maybe I should wake you
but by then it might be gone
You never know what you see
if you look up in the sky

I ran outside down a darkenend street
listening to my boot heels click
My leather jacket squeaked
I needed a cigarette
When I turned the corner
My spinning light was in the street
they were filming a commercial
on TV

Tell it to your heart
Please don't be afraid
We're no teenage movie
That ends in tragedy
Tell it to your heart
Please don't be afraid
N.Y.C. Lovers
Tell it to your heart

"The Tell-Tale Heart Pt. 1"
===========================
album _The Raven_
(Lou Reed, 2003)

written by Lou Reed
===========================



        True
        Nervous
        very nervous



        Madman



        Why will you say that I am mad
        The disease has sharpened my senses
        not destroyed
        not dulled them



        Madman



        The eye of a vulture
        a pale blue eye
        with a film overit



        Listen
        observe how healthily
        and how calmly I tell this story



        He had no passion for the old man
        He was never insulted



        He loved him



        It was the eye the eye the eye



        I made up my mind
        To take his life forever



        Passionless



        The eye of a vulture



        You should have seen me



        How wisely I proceeded



        To rid himself of the eye forever



        With what dissimulation I went to work



        Caution



        I turned the latch on his door
        and opened it



        To work



        To practice



        I opened his door
        and put in a dark lantern



        Dark



        Slowly I put my head in
        Slowly I thrust it until in time Ientered
        I was in so far



        He was in so far
        he could see the old man sleep



        And then I undid the lantern so a thin ray
        fell upon the eye



        The vulture eye



        He did this for seven days



        Seven days



        But always the eye was closed
        and so I could not do the work



        And in the day he would greet the old man
        calmly in his chamber



        Calmly



        Nothing is wrong and all is well



        Knock, knock
        who's there



        Came night eight



        Night eight



        I was slower than a watch minute hand
        The power that I had with the old man
        not to even dream my secret thoughts



        Secret thoughts



        My sagacity
        I could barely conceal my feelings of triumph



        When suddenly the body moved



        The body moved



        But I went in even further
        pushing the door open even further



        Who's there



        Who's there



        I did not move a muscle
        I kept quiet and still



        The old man sat up in bed



        In his bed



        Who's there



        I heard a groan
        and knew it was a groan of mortal terror
        not pain or grief



        Oh no



        It was the low stifled sound that arises
        from the bottom of the soul
        when overcharged with awe
        I felt such awe welling up in my own bosom
        deepening with its echo the terrors that distracted me
        Knowing what the old man felt and



        Pitying him



        Although it made me laugh



        Ha ha



        He'd been lying awake since the first slight noise
        He'd been lying awake thinking



        Thinking



        It is nothing but the wind



        The wind



        It is nothing but the house settling



        The old man stalked with his black shadow



        Death approaching



        The mournful presence of the unperceived
        causing him to feel my presence



        Open the lantern



        I saw the ray fall on the eye



        On the eye

===========================
album _The Raven_
(Lou Reed, 2003)

written by Lou Reed
===========================



        Furious



        It made me furious



        A dull quick sound pounding



        Like a watch encased in cotton



        Tick tock



        I knew that sound well



        It increased my fury



        The beating of the old man's heart



        I scarcely breathed and refrained



        Motionless



        The tattoo of the heart



        Hellish



        Increased and was extreme



        It grew louder



        Louder



        I am nervous at this dead hour of the night
        amid the dreadful silence of this old house
        this sound excites me to uncontrollable wrath
        I thought someone would hear this sound
        I thought his heart would burst



        His hour had come



        Please open the door
        Open the door



        The old man has gone to the country




        Gone to the country



        But please search well



        Please search well



        These are his treasures



        Treasures



        Secure and undisturbed



        Please sit and rest
        You must be fatigued



        Wild audacity
        Perfect triumph



        So they chat



        Chat



        Of familiar things



        I hear ringing



        Ringing



        Do you not hear it



        No



        It is louder
        It is making my head ache



        Do you not hear it



        No



        No



        No




        I, I have a headache
        The day is long
        Do you not hear it



        No



        Do you fucking mock me
        Do you mock me




        They know




        Do you think me



        They know



        An imbecile
        Do you think me a fool
        Villains dissemble no more



        I admit the deed



        Admit, Admit



        Here, here



        Admit



        It is the beating
        of his most hideous heart

        As far at least lies that valley
        as the bedridden sun in the luminous east
        The paralyzed mountains, the sickly river
        Are not all things lovely far away?
        Are not all things lovely far away?

        It is a valley where time is not interrupted
        Where its history shall not be interpreted
        Stories of Satan's dart
        Of angel wings
        Unhappy things
        Within the valley of unrest

        The sun ray dripped all red
        The dell was silent
        All the people having gone to war
        Leaving no interrogator to mind
        the willful looting the pale past knowledge
        The sly mysterious stars
        The unguarded flowers leaning
        The tulips overhead paler
        The terror-stricken sky
        Rolling like a waterfall
        over the horizon's fiery wall
        A visage full of meaning

        How the unhappy shall confess
        As Roderick watches like a human eye
        While the violets and lilies wave
        Like banners in the sky
        Hovering over and above a grave
        As dew drops on the freshly planted eternal dew
        Coming down in gems
        There's no use to pretend
        Though gorgeous clouds fly
        Roderick, like the human eye has closed forever
        Far away far away

        Roderick, whatever thy image may be
        Roderick, no magic shall sever the music from thee
        Thou hast bound many eyes in a dreamy sleep
        Oh tortured day
        The strains still arrive
        I hear the bells
        I have kept my vigilance
        Rain dancing in the rhythm of a shower
        Over what guilty spirit to not hear the beating
        To not hear the beating heart
        But only tears of perfect moan
        Only tears of perfect moan

===============================


        There is no reason
        to treat me this way
        Take all my love
        and just throw it way
        All of my hopes and dream
        you took away everything and -

        There is no reason
        there is no reason
        Treat me this way

        (You gonna keep this going)

        There is no reason
        to cause me such pain
        Turn out the sunlight
        turn on my rain
        All of my hopes and dream
        you took away everything and -

        There is no reason
        there is no reason
        To treat me this way

        All of my hopes and dream
        you took away everything

        There is no reason
        there is no reason
        To treat me this way

        Oh, baby, this way
        oh, you treat me this way
        Oh, baby, this way

"There Is No Time"
===================
album _New York_
(Lou Reed, 1989)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        This is no time for celebration
        this is no time for shaking heads
        This is no time for backslapping
        this is no time for marching bands

        This is no time for optimism
        this is no time for endless thought
        This is no time for my country right or wrong
        remember what that brought

        There is no time
        there is no time
        There is no time
        there is no time

        This is no time for congratulations
        this is no time to turn your back
        This is no time for circumlocution
        this is no time for learned speech

        This is no time to count your blessings
        this is no time for private gain
        This is no time to put up or shut up
        it won't come back this way again

        There is no time
        there is no time
        There is no time
        there is no time

        This is no time to swallow anger
        this is no time to ignore hate
        This is no time to be acting frivolous
        because the time is getting late

        This is no time for private vendettas
        this is no time to not know who you are
        Self knowledge is a dangerous thing
        the freedom of who you are

        This is no time to ignore warnings
        this is no time to clear the plate
        Let's not be sorry after the fact
        and let the past become out fate

        There is no time
        there is no time
        There is no time
        there is no time

        This is no time to turn away and drink
        or smoke some vials of crack
        This is a time to gather force
        and take dead aim and attack

        This is no time for celebration
        this is no time for saluting flags
        This is no time for inner searchings
        the future is at hand

        This is no time for phony rhetoric
        this is no time for political speech
        This is a time for action
        because the future's within reach

        This is the time
        this is the time
        This is the time
        because there is no time

        There is no time
        there is no time
        There is no time
        there is no time

"There She Goes Again"
=======================================
album _The Velvet Underground and Nico_
(The Velvet Underground, 1967)

written by Lou Reed
=======================================


        There she goes again
        she's out on the streets again
        She's down on her knees my friend
        but you know she'll never ask you please again

        Now take a look, there's no tears in her eyes
        she won't take it from just any guy

        What can you do
        you see her walkin' on down the street
        Look at all your friends that she's gonna meet
        you'd better hit her

        There she goes again
        she's knocked out on her feet again
        She's down on her knees my friend
        but you know she'll never ask you please again

        Now take a look, there's no tears in her eyes
        like a bird, you know she will fly

        What can you do
        you see her walkin' on down the street
        Look at all your friends that she's gonna meet
        you'd better hit her

        Now take a look, there's no tears in her eyes
        like a bird, you know she will fly

        Fly-fly away
        ah, see her walkin' on down the street
        look at all your friends that she's gonna meet
        She's gonna ball and shout
        she's gonna work it
        she's gonna work it out, bye-bye
        Bye-bye-bye-bye-bye, bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-bye, baby
        ah, she's alright, she's alright
        she's gonna work, oh ...

i was reviewing your latest updates
and i saw mat thomas's correction for 'im waiting for the man',
involving 'bawl and shout'.

i remember that the same lyric appears in 'there she goes again',
at the ending just before the fadeout (lou says it very, very fast).
the lyric which currently says :

she's gonna ball and shout,
she's gonna work it

should actually just say 'bawl' instead of 'ball'.
it means just about the same thing
it does in 'im waiting for the man';
'bawl' means 'to cry' and/or 'to complain'.

"These Days"
(take 1 - take 2)
=========================
rehearsal
(Lou Reed/Nico, 1970)

written by Jackson Browne

Apr 1970
hotel room, NYC
=========================


(take 1)

        [whistle] ........... (wal)-king
        I don't do too much talking these days

        These days
        These days I seem to think about
        how all the changes came about my ways

        La-la-la-la-la-la
        I had not forgotten them



(take 2)

        These days I sit on corner stones
        and count the time in quarter tones to ten

        I had not forgotten them

"These Days"
==================================
album _Chelsea Girl_
(Nico, 1967)

acoustic guitar by Jackson Browne

* Lou didn't play on this version.
(transcribed as a reference)
==================================


        I've been out walking
        I don't do too much talking these days

        These days
        These days I seem to think a lot
        about the things that I forgot to do
        And all the times I had
        the chance to

        I've stopped my rambling
        I don't do too much gambling these days

        These days
        These days I seem to think about
        how all the changes came about my ways
        And I wonder if I'll see another
        highway

        I had a lover
        I don't think I'll risk another these days

        These days
        And if I seem to be afraid
        to live the life that I have made in song
        It's just that I've been losing
        so long

        La-la-la-la-la
        la-la

        I've stopped my dreaming
        I won't do too much scheming these days

        These days
        These days I sit on corner stones
        and count the time in quarter tones to ten
        Please don't confront me with my failures
        I had not forgotten them

"Things Have Happened Strange"
==============================
album _Wild Angel_
(Nelson Slater, 1976)

written by Nelson Slater

Lou Reed: produce, guitar
==============================


        Dreaming like a baby
        an inquisitive child
        Working on a thing I can cling to
        something worthwhile

        Thoughts are just another outlet
        for this burning inside
        Love has found a strong foundation
        and this is why, baby

        Things have happened strange
        but mighty good things, woh
        Things have happened strange
        but mighty good things

        You may have bad days, everyone has them
        you many be lacking, enthusiasm

        Roamin' through the pages
        of a life I once lived
        Singing out a song to the phases
        of each thing I did

        Counting up the deep drop of water
        wondering why, don't you know that -

        Things have happened strange
        but mighty good things
        Oh, things have happened strange
        but mighty good things

        You may wear band-aids, have cuts and bruises
        but when the hurt fades, nobody loses

        But things have happened strange
        but mighty good things, why don't you just -
        Leave your trap and change
        your shackles to wings, don't you know that -
        Things have happened strange
        but mighty good things

"Think It Over"
===================================
album _Growing Up In Public_
(Lou Reed, 1980)

written by Lou Reed/Michael Fonfara
===================================


        Waking, he stared raptly at her face
        on his lips, her smell, her taste
        Black hair framing her perfect face
        with her wonderful mind and her incredible grace

        And so, he woke, he woke her with a start
        to offer her his heart
        for once and for all, forever to keep
        And the words, that she first heard him speak
        were really very sweet
        he was asking her to marry him, and to

        Think it over
        baby, think it over
        Think it over
        baby, why don't you think it over

        She said, somewhere, there's a faraway place
        where all is ordered and all is grace
        No one there is ever disgraced
        and everyone there is wise and everyone has taste

        And then she sighed, well la-dee-dah-dee-dah
        you and I have come quite far
        and we really must watch what we say
        Because when you ask for someone's heart
        you must know that you're smart
        smart enough to care for it, so I'm gonna

        Think it over
        baby, think it over
        Think it over
        Baby, I'm gonna think it over

Maybe it helps.


Think It Over

Waking, he stared raptly at her face
On her lips, her smell, her taste
Black hair framing her perfect face
With her wonderful mind and her incredible grace
And so, he woke he woke her with a start
To offer her his heart
Once and for all, forever to keep
And the words that she first heard him speak
Were really very sweet
He was asking her to marry him, and to
Think it over
Baby, think it over
Think it over
Baby, why don't you think it over

She said somewhere there's a faraway place
Where all is ordered and all is grace
No one there is ever disgraced
And everybody there is wise
And everyone has taste
And then she sighed
Well La, Dee, Dah, Dee, Dah
You and I have some quite far
And we really must watch what we say
Because when you
Ask for someone's heart
You must know that you're smart
Smart enough to care for it
So I'm gonna
Think it over
Baby think it over
Think it over
Baby, I'm gonna think it over

Lou Reed: cameo vocal
=============================


        This is your land, it's the way it was planned
        sky to the sea, something to see
        Old ancient town to the old people ground
        I wanna know, something to go

        This is your land, laid out in your hand
        this is your land
        Wherever I go
        way down here I know

        This is your land

        Oh, churches and steeples, big city people
        I wanna know something to hold
        Walk down the track to the old railroad track
        I wanna leave something to see

        This is your land, laid out in your hand
        this is your land
        Wherever I go
        way down here I know

        This is your land

Lou:    MONEY CAN'T BUY ME
        MONEY CAN'T BUY ME
        I'VE GOT TIME
        TIME IS ON MY SIDE

        You don't know what you've got till the whole thing's gone
        the days are dark and the road is long
Lou:    AND WHEN YOU WALK AWAY, THE HOPE IS GONE
        TELL ME WHAT IS RIGHT, WHAT IS WRONG

        Is this the way it was planned

        And this is your land, take it in your hand
        this is your land
        Wherever I go
        way down here I know

        Ah, this is your land, take it in your hand

        This magic moment
        so different and so new
        Was like any other
        until I met you

        And then it happened
        you took me by surprise
        I knew that you felt it too
        I could see it by the look in your eyes

        Sweeter than wine
        softer than a summer's night
        Everything I want, I have
        whenever I hold you tight

        This magic moment
        while your lips are close to mine
        Will last forever
        Forever till the end of time

        So why won't you dance with me
        Hey babe

        This is the rose my true love gave to me

Lou Reed: lyric reading
===========================================


        Come, let me sing into your ear
        those dancing days are gone
        all that silk and satin gear
        crouch upon a stone
        Wrapping that foul body up
        in as foul a rag

        I carry the sun in a golden cup
        the moon in a silver bag
        I carry the sun in a golden cup
        the moon in a silver bag

        Curse as you may I sing it through
        what matter if the knave
        that the most could pleasure you
        the children that he gave
        Are somewhere sleeping like a top
        under a marble flag?

        I carry the sun in a golden cup
        the moon in a silver bag
        I carry the sun in a golden cup
        the moon in a silver bag

        Come, let me sing into your ear
        I thought it out this very day, noon upon the clock
        all that silk and satin gear
        a man may put pretence away, who leans upon a stick
        May sing, and sing until he drop
        whether to maid or hag

        I carry the sun in a golden cup
        the moon in a silver bag
        I carry the sun in a golden cup
        the moon in a silver bag, huh

        Mmmm.., yeah
        mmmm..
        mmmm..
        mmmm..

Lou     Ah
        Come, let me sing into your ear
        Those dancing days are gone
        All that silk and satin gear
        Crouch upon a stone
        Wrapping that foul body up
        In as foul a rag
        I carry the sun in a golden cup
        The moon in a silver bag
        Curse as you may
        I sing it through
        What matter if the knave
        That the most could pleasure you
        The children that he gave
        Are somewhere sleeping like a top
        Under a marble flag?
        I carry the sun in a golden cup
        The moon in a silver bag
        I thought it out this very day
        Noon upon the clock
        A man may put pretence away
        Who leans upon a stick
        May sing, and sing until he drop
        Whether to maid or hag
        I carry the sun in a golden cup
        The moon in a silver bag

"Tracks Of My Tears"
==========================
unreleased live
(Lou Reed, 1994)

written by Smokey Robinson

Feb 19, 1994
Shrine Auditorium, LA
==========================


        People say I'm the life of the party
        'cause I tell a joke or two
        Although I may be laughing so loud and hearty
        oh, deep inside, baby, I'm blue

        So take a good look at my face
        you know my smile looks out of place
        baby, look a little bit, little bit -
        - Closer, easy to trace
        tracks of my tears

        I need you, I need you

        Since you left me you've been seem with another guy
        seems like you're having fun, hah
        Although you may be cute and another pretty face
        you're just a substitute
        because baby, you know I'm your permanent one

        Take a good look at my face
        you know my smile looks out of place
        hey little bit, of a little bit -
        - Closer, it's easy to trace
        the tracks of my tears

        I need you, need you

        Outside, I'm masquerading
        inside, my hope is fading
        I'm just a clown, since you put me down
        My smile is my make up inside since I broke up with you

        Baby, baby
        baby-baby-baby

        Take a good look at my face
        you know my smile looks out of place
        just a little bit, little bit -
        - Closer, babe, it's easy to trace
        the tracks of my tears

"Trade In"
================================
album _Set The Twilight Reeling_
(Lou Reed, 1996)

written by Lou Reed
================================


        I met a new me at 8 a.m.
        the other one got lost
        this was not a trade in
        although I wouldn't believe the cost
        I woke up crying as we said goodbye
        me and my old self, each day he vanished more and more
        as I became someone else

        He actually was murdered
        I'd taken him apart
        but when I put him back together
        I couldn't find his heart
        It was resting underneath a chair
        in a bed of bright tin-foil
        if I pulled back the flaps, I could still see it beat
        I could still hear his voice uncoil, as I said -

        I want a trade in
        a 14th chance at this life
        I met a woman with a thousand faces
        and I want to make her my wife

        How could I have been so mistaken
        how could I think that it was true
        a child that is raised by an idiot
        and that idiot then becomes you
        How could I believe in a movie
        how could I believe in a book
        but most of all how could I listen to you
        such an obvious schmuck
        A life spent listening to assholes
        it's funny but it's true
        so get rid of them I said to myself
        but first I'm, I'm getting rid of you

        I want a trade in
        a 14th chance at this life
        I met a woman with a thousand faces
        and I'm goin' to make her my wife

        Take me over to the window
        my heart said to my head
        please set me on fire
        so we can start again
        I was so wrong that it's funny
        and I can't apologize
        but instead, you can be everything that I'm not
        the second that I die

        Ooohhh, I want a trade in
        second chance at this life
        I met a woman with a thousand faces
        and I want to make her my wife

        Hah

        A 14th chance at this life
        I want a trade in, a thousand faces, a thousand faces
        Trade, I said to me trade, mmmm..
        14th, 14th chance at this -
        - Life

"Train Round The Bend"
==============================
album _Loaded_
(The Velvet Underground, 1970)

written by Lou Reed
==============================


        Train headin' round the bend
        takin' me away from the country
        I'm sick of the trees, take me to the city

        Train goin' round the bend
        oh, train comin' round the bend, ah

        Been in the country, oh, much too long
        tryin' to be a farmer
        But nothing that I planted, ever seemed to grow

        Train comin' round the bend, ooohhh, whoa
        train comin' round the bend

        Hey, I'm just a city boy
        I'm really not the country kind
        Oh, I miss the city streets and the neon lights

        You see the train comin' round the bend, ooohhh, wow
        the train comin' round the bend

        All right, ooohhh, ooohhh ...

        Once, she's going twice
        she's going good up and down
        She's going once, she's going twice

        Ah, she's gonna, train comin' round the bend
        you know, the train comin' round the bend

        Then along out of nowhere
        takin' me back where I belong
        I've been here once, and I don't think it's too nice

        But the train comin' round the bend, ooohhh
        the train comin' round the bend
        ahhh, all right

I found some errors in your transcription of the lyrics.



Train headin' round the bend
Takin' me away from the country
I'm sick of the cheese, take me to the city
Train goin' round the bend
Oh, train comin' round the bend, ah

Been in the country, oh, much too long
Tryin' to be a farmer
But nothing that I planted, ever seemed to grow
Train comin' round the bend, whoa
Train comin' round the bend

Hey, I'm just a city boy
I'm really not the country kind
Oh, I miss the city streets and the neon lights
You see the train comin' round the bend, oha
The train comin' round the bend

Once, she's going twice
She's going good up and down
She's going once, she's gone twice
Oh, she's gonna, train comin' round the bend
You know, the train comin' round the bend

**** out of nowhere
Takin' me back where I belong
I've been here once, and I don't think it's too nice
But the train's comin' round the bend, wow
The train's comin' round the bend

Headin' tumblin' around the bend
Take me back where I belong
I've been in the country, many, much too long
The train comin' round the bend, look out boy
The train's comin' round the bend, boy


------------------------------------------------------------------------

As you can see I edited out the "In and out of nowhere",
because as far as I can hear that isn't what he's singing.
I couldn't hear what he do sing, though, but maybe someone else can.

I think the line is "I'm sick of the trees..." not cheese
but I'll have another listen.
The other line I believe is "Then along out of nowhere"
but I confess its been a month or so since I last played it.

"Tranquilize"
======================================
album _Sawdust_
(The Killers, 2007)

written by Brandon Flowers

Lou Reed: additional guitar and vocals
======================================


        Time it tells living in my home town
        wedding bells they begin easy
        Live it down, baby don't talk that much
        baby knows that baby don't tease me

        In the park we could go walking
        drown in the dark or we could go sailing
        On the sea

        Always here, always on time close call
        was it love or was it just easy
        Money talks when people need shoes and socks
        steady boys, I'm thinking she needs me

        I was just sipping on something sweet
        I don't need political process

        I got this feeling that they're gonna break down the door
        I got this feeling I'm gonna come back for more
        See I was thinking that I lost my mind
        but it's been getting to me all this time
        And it don't stop dragging me down

        Silently reflection turns my world to stone
        Patiently correction leaves us all alone
        And sometimes I'm a traveling man
        but tonight this engine's failing
        I still hear the children playing

        Kick the can, kick the can, skip and blackjack
        steal a car and ring a round rosie
        Rock and roll, candyland, boogieman
        run away and give me your sneakers

        Acid rain, when Abel looked up at Cain
        we began the weeping and wailing
        Ah hurried high from pestilence, pills and pride
        it's a shame, we could've gone sailing

        But heaven knows, heaven knows everything
        tranquilize

        I got this feeling that they're gonna break down the door
        I got this feeling that they're gonna come back for more
        See I was thinking that I lost my mind
        but it's been getting to me all this time
        And it don't stop dragging me down

        Silently reflection turns my world to stone
        Patiently correction leaves us all alone
        And sometimes I'm traveling man
        but tonight this engine's failing

        I still hear the children playing
        Dead beat dancers come to us and stay

        Cause I don't care where you been
        and I don't care what you seen
        We're the ones who still believe
        and we're looking for a page
        In that lifeless book of hope
        where a dream might help you cope
        With the bushes and the bombs
        ah huh tranquilized

"Tripitena's Speech"
====================
album _The Raven_
(Lou Reed, 2003)

written by Lou Reed
====================



Tripitena:

        My love
        The king by any other name a pissoir
        You, my love tower over them all
        they are but vermin beneath your heels
        They are monkeys
        Suit them, frame them to your own vision
        but do not let one false word
        of mockery seep through to your vast heart
        I have seen you from close and afar and your worth
        far exceeds your height, your width
        the depth of your sorrow
        Oh willful outcast doth thou not see the light of our love
        our linked fortunes
        our hearts melded together
        into one fine golden braided finery
        They listen to the music of idiots and amuse themselves
        with the sordid Miseries of their businesses
        They are not the things of angels
        nor of any higher outpost that humanity might aspire to
        Your loathsome vomitous
        businessman king is of the lowest order
        his advisors
        crumbling mockeries of education driven by avarice
        My love
        dress them in the suits of mockery
        and in their advanced state of stupidity
        and senility
        burn and destroy them so their ashes might join the compost
        which they so much deserve
        If justice on this earth be fleeting
        let us for once hear the weeping
        and the braying of the businessman king
        Let them be the the orangutans they are
        and set them blazing from the chandelier for all to see
        hanging from the ceiling by their ridiculous chains
        and petticoats which you will have them wear
        under the guise of costumic buffoonery
        He who underestimates
        in time is bound to find the truth sublime
        and hollow lie upon the grates of systemic disorder
        Businessmen
        you're not worth shitting on

"Trouble With Classicists"
=============================
album _Songs For Drella_
(Lou Reed/John Cale, 1990)

written by Lou Reed/John Cale

sung by John Cale
=============================


        The trouble with a classicist
        he looks at a tree
        that's all he sees
        he paints a tree
        The trouble with a classicist
        he looks at the sky
        he doesn't ask why
        he just paints a sky

        The trouble with an impressionist
        he looks at a log
        he doesn't know who he is
        standing, staring at this log
        And surrealist memories
        are too amorphous and proud
        while those downtown macho painters
        are just alcoholic

        The trouble with impressionists
        that's the trouble with impressionists
        That's the trouble with impressionists
        that's the trouble with impressionists

        The trouble with personalities
        they're too wrapped up in style
        it's too personal
        they're in love with their own guile
        They're like illegal aliens
        trying to make a buck
        they're driving gypsy cabs
        but they're thinking like a truck

        That's the trouble with personalities
        that's the trouble with personalities
        That's the trouble with personalities
        that's the trouble with personalities

        I like the druggy downtown kids
        who spray-paint walls and trains
        I like their lack of training
        their primitive technique
        I think sometimes it hurts you
        when you stay too long in school
        I think sometimes it hurts you
        when you're afraid to be called a fool

        That's the trouble with classicists
        that's the trouble with classicists
        That's the trouble with classicists
        that's the trouble with classicists

"Turn Out The Light"
========================
album _Legendary Hearts_
(Lou Reed, 1983)

written by Lou Reed
========================


        Lover-lover why is there light
        in the itchy gitchy evening and it's dark outside
        and what is the difference between wrong and right
        wrong and right

        Isn't it funny how pain goes away
        and then comes back another day
        the air feels very good today
        good today

        Lover-lover why is there light
        did you forget to turn off that light
        well that's all right but it was way too bright
        way too bright

        See the eagle above the hill
        the lake reflects and is so still
        the tension has gone from my will
        from my will

        Moon on the mountain shining bright
        first there's dark and then there's light
        and sometimes the light is way too bright
        it's way to bright

        Why don't you turn off the light
        oh, turn off the light
        why don't you turn off the light
        turn off the light
        turn off the light

        Turn off the light

"Turn To Me"
======================
album _New Sensations_
(Lou Reed, 1984)

written by Lou Reed
======================


        If you gave up major vices
        you're between a hard place and a wall
        And your car breaks down in traffic
        on the street
        Remember, I'm the one who loves you
        you can always give me a call
        Turn to me, turn to me
        baby, turn to me

        If your father is free basing
        and your mother turning tricks
        That's still no reason
        you should have a rip
        Remember, I'm the one who loves you
        you can always give me a call
        Turn to me, turn to me
        turn to me

        When your teeth are ground down to the bone
        and there's nothing between your legs
        And some friend died of something
        that you can't pronounce, ah
        Remember, I'm the one who loves you
        hey baby, you can always give me a call
        Turn to me, turn to me
        turn to me

        You can't pay your rent, your boss is an idiot
        and your apartment has no heat
        And your wife says, "Maybe
        it's time to have a child"
        Remember, I'm the one who loves you
        and you can always give me a call
        Turn to me, turn to me
        turn to me

        When it's all too much you turn the TV set on
        and light a cigarette
        And then a public service announcement
        comes creeping on
        And you see a lung corroding
        or a fatal heart attack
        Turn to me, turn to me
        baby, turn to me, I'm just a phone call away

        Turn to me, turn to me
        hey, turn to me, one .... a dollar
        Turn to me, baby
        turn to me
        (Turn to me, turn to me
        turn to me)
        (Turn to me, turn to me
        turn to me)

"Turning Time Around"
===========================================
album _Ecstasy_
(Lou Reed, 2000)

written by Lou Reed

* written for the play _Time Rocker_ (1996)
===========================================


        She says, what do you call love
        well I call it Harry
        Oh, please I'm being serious
        what do you call love

        Well I don't call it family and I don't call it lust
        and as we all know marriage isn't a must
        And I suppose in the end, it's a matter of trust
        if I had to I'd call love time

        She says, what do you call love
        can't you be more specific
        What do you call love
        is it more than the heart's hieroglyphic

        Well for me time has no meaning, no future, no past
        and when you're in love, you don't have to ask
        There's never enough time to hold love in your grasp
        turning time around

        Turning time around
        that is what love is
        Turning time around
        yes, that is what love is

        My time is your time when you're in love
        and time is what you never have enough of
        You can't see or hold it, it's exactly like love

        Turning time around
        turning time around
        Turning time around
        turning time around
        Turning time around
        well I gotta have it
        I gotta-gotta-gotta have it

        Turning, turning time around
        gotta have it, turning time around
        Turning, turning time around
        turning time around

They are the exact words he sings,

Turning time around
--------------------
She says: what do you call love
Well I call it Harry
Ah please, I'm being serious
What do you call love
Well I don't call it family
And I don't call it lust
And as we all know, marriage isn't a must
And I suppose in the end it's a matter of trust
If I had to I'd call love time
She said: what do you call love
Can't you be more specific
What do you call love
Is it more than the hearts hieroglyphic
Well for me time has no meaning
No future, no past
And when you're in love, you don't have to ask
There's never enough time to hold love in your grasp
Turning time around
Turning time around
That's what love is
Turning time around
Yes, that's what love is
My time is your time
When you're in love
And time is what you never have enough of
You can't see or hold it
It's exactly like love
Turning time around
Turning time around
Turning time around
Turning time around
Turning time around

Well I gotta have it
I gotta gotta gotta have it
Turning time around
Well I gotta have it
Turning time around
Turning, turning time around
Turning time around

"Underneath The Bottle"
=======================
album _The Blue Mask_
(Lou Reed, 1982)

written by Lou Reed
=======================


        Ooohhh-wheee, look at me
        lookin' for some sympathy
        It's the same old story -
        - of man and his search for glory
        and he found it, there underneath the bottle

        Things are never good, things go from bad to weird
        hey gimmie another scotch with my beer
        I'm sad to say -
        - I feel the same today as I always do
        gimmie a drink to relax me

        Ooohhh-wheee, liquor set me free
        I can't do no work, the shakes inside me
        Ah shucks
        I got the lousiest luck, I'm sick of this
        underneath the bottle

        Seven days make a week, on two of them I sleep
        I can't remember what the heck I was doin'
        I got bruises on my leg -
        - from I can't remember when
        I fell down some stairs, I was lyin' underneath the bottle

        Ooohhh-wheee, son of a B
        you get so down, you can't get any lower
        So long world you play too rough
        and it's getting me all mixed up
        I lost my pride and it's hiddin' there underneath the bottle

"Vanishing Act"

album _The Raven_

written by Lou Reed
===================


        It must be nice to disappear
        to have a vanishing act
        to always be looking forward
        and never looking back

        How nice it is to disappear
        float into a mist
        with a young lady on your arm
        looking for a kiss

        It might be nice to disappear
        to have a vanishing act
        to always be looking forward
        never look over your back

        It must be nice to disappear
        float into a mist
        with a young lady on your arm
        looking for a kiss

        It must be nice to disappear
        to have a vanishing act
        to always be moving forward
        and never looking back

        How nice it is to disappear
        float into a mist
        with a young lady on your arm
        looking for a kiss

        Looking for a kiss
        float into a mist

        Shiny shiny, shiny boots of leather
        whiplash girlchild in the dark
        Comes in bells, your servant, don't forsake him
        strike dear mistress and cure his heart

        Downy sins of streetlight fancies
        chase the costumes she shall wear
        Ermine furs adorn imperious
        Severin, Severin awaits you there

        I am tired, I am weary
        I could sleep for a thousand years
        A thousand dreams that would awake me
        different colors made of tears

        Kiss the boot of shiny shiny leather
        shiny leather in the dark
        Tongue of thongs, the belt that does await you
        strike dear mistress and cure his heart

        Severin, Severin, speak so slightly
        Severin, down on your bended knee
        Taste the whip, in love not given lightly
        taste the whip, now bleed for me

        I am tired, I am weary
        I could sleep for a thousand years
        A thousand dreams that would awake me
        different colors made of tears

        Shiny shiny, shiny boots of leather
        whiplash girlchild in the dark
        Severin your servant, comes in bells
        please don't forsake him
        strike dear mistress and cure his heart

"Vicious"
===================
album _Transformer_
(Lou Reed, 1972)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        Vicious
        you hit me with a flower
        You do it every hour
        oh baby, you're so vicious

        Vicious
        you want me to hit you with a stick
        But all I've got's a guitar pick
        huh baby, you're so vicious

        When I watch you come
        baby, I just wanna run far away
        You're not the kind of person around I -
        - wanna stay

        When I see you walking down the street
        I step on your hands and I mangle your feet
        You're not the kind of person that I want to meet

        Oh baby, you're so vicious
        you're just so vicious

        Vicious
        hey, you hit me with a flower
        You do it every hour
        oh baby, you're so vicious

        Vicious
        hey, why don't you swallow razor blades
        You must think that I'm some kind of gay blade
        but baby, you're so vicious

"Vicious"
==========================================
album _American Poet_

Dec 26, 1972
Ultrasonic Recording Studio, Hempstead, NY
==========================================


        Vicious
        you hit me with a flower
        You do it every hour
        and baby, you're so vicious

        Vicious
        you want me to hit you with a stick
        But all I've got's a guitar pick
        and baby, you're so vicious

        When I see you comin'
        baby, I just wanna run far away
        You're not the kind of person around
        that I want to stay

        When I see you walking down the street
        I step on your hands and I mangle your feet
        You're not the kind of person that I really want to meet

        'Cause you're so vicious
        oh darling, you're so vicious

        Vicious
        you hit me with a flower
        You do it every hour
        and baby, you're so vicious

        Vicious
        why don't you swallow razor blades
        You must think I'm some kinda gay blade
        and baby, you're so vicious

        When I see you comin'
        baby, I just want to run
        You're not very good and you're not really even -
        - very much fun

        When I see you walking down the street
        I step on your hands and I mangle your feet
        You're not the kind of person that I really want to meet

        'Cause you're so vicious
        baby, you're so vicious
        Ah darling, you're so vicious
        oh baby, you're so vicious

hi. this is really no big deal
but in the lyrics for the perfect night version of vicious
i think he says, "hey tony, let me know that you're there big guy."
that's just what it sounds like to me.
like i said, no big deal.

(Lou Reed, 1976)

written by Lou Reed
===========================


        You're caught in a vicious circle
        surrounded by your so-called friends
        You're caught in a vicious circle
        and it looks like it will never end

        'Cause some people think that they like problems
        and some people think that they don't
        And for everybody who says yes
        there's somebody whose staring saying don't

        You're caught in a vicious circle
        surrounded by your so-called friends
        You're caught in a vicious circle
        and it looks like it will just never end

        'Cause some people think that it's nerves
        and some people think that it's not
        And some people think that it's things that you do
        and others think that you were cold when you were hot
        They think that that was what it was all about

        You're caught in a vicious circle
        You're caught in a vicious circle
        You're caught in a vicious circle
        You're caught in a vicious circle
        surrounded by all of your friends

"Video Violence"
===================
album _Mistrial_
(Lou Reed, 1986)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        The currents rage deep inside us
        this is the age of video violence
        The currents rage so deep inside us
        this is the age of video violence

        Up in the morning, drinking his coffee
        turns on the TV to some slasher movie
        Cartoon-like women, tied up and sweaty
        painting and screaming, thank you, have a nice day

        the currents rage, the dawn's upon us
        this is the age of video violence
        The currents rage so deep inside us
        this is the age of video violence

        Na-na-na, na-na-na
        na-na-na, na-na-na

        His heart is pounding he switches the channel
        looking for something other than rape or murder
        Or beatings or torture but except for Walt Disney
        it's a twisted alliance, this age of video violence

        The currents rage, the dawn's upon us
        this is the age of video violence
        The current rage so deep inside us
        this is the age of video violence

        Down at his job, his boss sits there screaming
        if he loses his job, then life loses its meaning
        His son is in high school, there's nothing he's learning
        he sits by the TV, watching Corvettes exploding 'cause

        The currents rage, the dawn's upon us
        this is the age of video violence
        No age of reason landing upon us
        this is the age of video violence

        Na-na-na, na-na-na
        na-na-na, na-na-na

        Down at a bar some woman is topless
        she's acned and scarred, her hair is a mess
        While he shoves 5 dollars down her exotic panties
        the video jukebox is, ah, playing Madonna
        While just down the block at some local theater
        they're grabbing their crotches at the 13th beheading
        As the dead rise to live, the live sink to die
        the currents are deep and raging inside

        The currents rage so deep inside us
        this is the age of video violence
        No age of reason is landing upon us
        this is the age of video violence

        Na-na-na, na-na-na
        na-na-na, na-na-na
        Na-na-na, na-na-na
        na-na-na, na-na-na

        Our good working stiff looks a whore in the eye
        ties her to a bed while he beats her back bloody
        And then back at home, drinking more instant coffee
        calls some red-neck evangelist that he's seen on TV and says

        The currents rage, the dawn's upon us

Na Na Na Na Na Na
Na Na Na Na Na Na

His heart is pounding he switches the channel
looking for something
other than rape or murder
or beatings or torture
but except for Walt Disney
it's a twisted alliance
this age of Video Violence

The currents rage, the dawn's upon us
This is the age of Video Violence
The current rage so deep inside us
This is the age of Video Violence

Down at his job his boss sits there screaming
if he loses his job, life looses its meaning
his son is in high school
there's nothing he's learniung
he sits by the TV
Watching Corvettes exploding, 'cause

The currents rage, the dawn's upon us
This is the age of Video Violence
No age of reason landing upon us
This is the age of Video Violence

Na Na Na Na Na Na
Na Na Na Na Na Na

Down at a bar some woman is topless
she's acned and scarred, her hair is a mess
While he shoves $5 down her exotic panties
the video jukebox is playing Madonna
while just down the block
at some local theater
they're grabbing their crotches
at the 13th beheading
as the dead rise to live
the live sink to die
the currents are deep and raging inside

The currents rage so deep inside us
This is the age of Video Violence
No age of reason is landing upon us
This is the age of Video Violence

Na Na Na Na Na Na
Na Na Na Na Na Na

Our good working stiff looks a whore in the eye
ties her to a bed
while he beats her back bloody
and then back at home
drinking more instant coffee
calls some red-neck evangelist
that he's seen on TV and says

The currents rage, the dawn's upon us
This is the age of Video Violence
No age of reason is landing upon us
This is the age of Video Violence

The currents rage so deep upon us
This is the age of Video violence
the currents rage so deep down inside us
This is the age of Video Violence

Na Na Na Na Na Na
Na Na Na Na Na Na

        Hey, if you're looking for a little action

        Oh heavenly father, what can I do
        what she's done to me is making me crazy
        Oh heavenly father, I know I have sinned
        but look where I've been, it's making me lazy

I just thought I might tell you:
"Wagon wheel" from "Transformer"
is actually written by David Bowie,
not Lou Reed as it says inside the cover.
This is a "secret" that has become known in the past years.

"Wait"
=====================
album _Street Hassle_
(Lou Reed, 1978)

written by Lou Reed
=====================


        Wait
        (disgrace)
        I know I shouldn't, but please wait
        (such a pretty face)
        I know the time is getting late
        (and it was such a waste)
        and he is lost who hesitates
        (of such a pretty face)
        But still I really wish that you'd wait
        (and it was such a waste)
        although this passion might abate
        (of such a pretty face)
        And find you in another state
        (it was such a disgrace)
        that will see this as some mistake
        (it was such a waste)
        Oh babe, I really think you oughta wait
        (of such a pretty face)

        Wait
        (it was such a waste)
        I really wouldn't want your hate

I was looking at 'Wait.'
You have the song fading out to the lyric '...someday'.
I think it's the backing singers coming in with a line
from an old doowop song ending in ...
I met him on a sunday.
So...sunday instead of someday...?

        When you walk
        you know you're gonna walk alone
        Honey, when you talk
        you're always gonna talk alone
        All alone (all alone)
        you know you're gonna talk alone
        All alone (all alone)
        you know you're gonna talk alone

        When you make love
        you know you're gonna love it alone
        When you make love
        you know you're gonna love it alone
        All alone
        you know you're gonna love it alone
        All alone

        Honey, when you die
        you know you're gonna die alone
        When you die
        you know you're gonna die alone
        Baby, all alone
        you know you're gonna die alone
        Honey, all alone
        you know you're gonna die alone

        When you dream
        you know you're gonna dream alone
        Honey, when you dream
        in your mind all alone
        All alone
        you know you're gonna do it alone
        All alone
        you know you're gonna do it alone

        I got hearts, ah, in my looney tunes
        I got dreams and you do, too
        I got ten wheel drive
        to pick you up, up to your ears, oh

        I got refined carbon in my eyelids, dear
        I've got no one to love and no one to fear

        You better walk it
        and talk it less you lose that beat
        You better lose yourself mama
        and knock yourself right off of your feet

        If you're moving too fast
        don't you want it to last
        You better walk it, talk it
        you better walk it as you talk it less you lose that beat
        oh

        I've got dimes in my shoes real nice
        I've got bells that are laid on ice
        I've got dreams
        let me mix it with a little gin

        I got cool when I'm cold and warm when I'm hot
        but me is the one thing baby, you ain't got

        and knock yourself right off of your feet

        Yeah, if you're moving too fast
        now don't you want it to last, ah

        Yeah, if you're moving too fast
        don't you want it to last
        You better walk it, walk it, talk it, talk it
        walk it as you talk it less you lose that beat
        Ah-huh-huh
        yeah alright
        .... baby



* chords: same as _Lou Reed_ version
They played using down-tuning

"Walk On The Wild Side"
=========================
album _Transformer_
(Lou Reed, 1972)

written by Lou Reed
=========================


        Holly came from Miami F-L-A
        hitchhiked her way across the U.S.A.

        Plucked her eyebrows on the way
        shaved her legs and then he was a she
        She says, hey babe, take a walk on the wild side
        said, hey honey, take a walk on the wild side

        Candy came from out on the island
        in the backroom she was everybody's darling

        But she never lost her head
        even when she was givin' head
        She says, hey babe, take a walk on the wild side
        said, hey babe, take a walk on the wild side
        and the colored girls go

        Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
        doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
        doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
        doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
        (Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo)
        (doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo)
        (doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo)
        (doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo)
        (Doo)

        Little Joe never once gave it away
        everybody had to pay and pay

        A hustle here and a hustle there
        New York City is the place where they said
        Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side
        I said, hey Joe, take a walk on the wild side

        Sugar Plum Fairy came and hit the streets
        lookin' for soul food and a place to eat

        Went to the Apollo
        you should have seen him go-go-go
        They said, hey Sugar, take a walk on the wild side
        I said, hey babe, take a walk on the wild side
        all right, huh

        Jackie is just speeding away
        thought she was James Dean for a day

        Then I guess she had to crash
        valium would have helped that bash
        She said, hey babe, take a walk on the wild side
        I said, hey honey, take a walk on the wild side
        and the colored girls say

        Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
        doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
        doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
        doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
        (Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo)
        (doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo)
        (doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo)
        (doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo)
        (Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo)
        (doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo)

        Plucked her eyebrows on the way
        then she shaved her legs, hey honey (she said)
        Hey men, come on, you take a walk on the wild side
        I love you, come in and take a walk on the wild side
        right

        when you go and go and go and say
        Hey men, come on and take a walk on the wild side
        I love you, damn-damn-damn and take a walk on the wild side

        Jackie she's just
        speeding away thought she might be James Dean for a day

        Then you know that she had to crash
        and some valium would have helped that bash, she said now
        Hey Jackie, come on and take a walk on the wild side
        I love you baby, come on and take a walk on the wild side

        Candy came from out on mass of people Long Island
        in the backroom, baby, she was everybody's darling

        But she never once lost her head
        even when she was givin' you the greatest head, they said

        I love you baby, come on and take a walk on the wild side

"Walk On The Wild Side"
=================================
rehearsal
(Lou Reed, 1971)

* different lyrics

1971
Richard Robinson's apartment, NYC
=================================


        Darling Honey walkin' down the street
        lookin' so far he's got no place to put his feet

        Off the Broadway by the top
        you never know until you get a rag-mop
        Take a walk on the wild side
        take a walk on the wild side

        All the way until you get to 42
        look at all the things you know you're gonna do

        Up unto the Empire State
        You never know until you gotta wait
        Take a walk on the wild side, ooohhh
        take a walk on the wild side
        listen to the girls ....

        Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
        doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
        doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
        doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

        Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
        doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
        doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
        doo, doo-doo, doo-doo

        Every time I got a place that I could see
        everything in this poor world happens to me

        Walkin' along around the top
        you never know when it's gonna stop
        Take a walk on the wild side, then I says, hey -
        babe, take a walk on the wild side, one more time now -
        Come on there, take a walk on the wild side
        almost ....., take a walk on the wild side

        Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
        doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
        doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
        doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

        Doo

it took a while,
but it is a starting point for the lyrics of this album.
(Take No Prisoners)


====


Sorry.
We had some kind of a nudge here the other night now.
There's no place to put the fucking glass so I
I put it on the floor.
Do you want to get the fucking ... cause it costs so fucking much.
There's a lunatic out there he comes after the show,
says I want to talk to that fucking Reed man
why did he throw a cup at his roadie.
Five cops and he hits a cop.
Hey and he had his brother here right and he punches a cop.
I want to talk to Lou about the ...
so next time you're wondering.
And I don't live that far from here...

What.
Surprised you...
It's not my fault man.

Twenty thousand years man come on...
I'd sworn to have a choir here for a week...
And if yo don't get that you get the play...
two hours for fourtythousand animals throwing beercans at you...
oh but that's rock n' roll
bullshit. Not behind my back


"Walk On The Wild Side"


We know the rhythm come on
Eight measures
Don't you show any passion
You show any emotion I fire you

I am not sure that we did this song all week.
It's not that I don't want to play your favourites just,
there's so many favourites to choose. So.
But ... I
I was so sick of that song.
I don't get sick of my own songs I like my own songs.
There's so we haven't done in a while.
That's only do it tonight.
Not because I like you because now I'm not bored with it.
Everybody gets bored with somebody sometimes.
But me, I'm lonely.
Me and my several selves discussed it that night.
Lou number one, Lou, Lou number five.
Hallo, you again reformer mea culpa. Hah.

Holly came from Miami F.L.A.

I have no attitude without a cigarette.
I rather have ... than be a faggot so.
That was an .... remark coming from me.
Like going to bed with a... it's out of style.
What's in style. Nothing is in style man...

Saturday night man what do you want.
Aha. ... to Lou Reed.
I do Lou Reed better than anybody.
I thought you deny...
I have not the attitude to kill every person in Jersey.
Ask him...

Holly came from Miami F.L.A.
Hitch-hiked her way all way across the U.S.A.
Plucked her eyebrows on the way
Shaved his leg and then he was a she

She says, hey babe, take a walk on the wild side
Said, hey honey, take a walk on the wild side

Would you like to know how.....
so I call you tomorrow.
That's an ...
believe it or not
the first time I quit rock n' roll because of too many bosses.
I could not afford my lawyers.
I still can't right now... government as partners.
Fantastic I got to go...
go in a night club...
let's play guitar,
hi Bruce.
Springsteen is alright by the way.
Get my seal proof.
I think he's groovy.
You know it's the way the critics turned on him
like after they were on him right.
When he needed them they went there in no time.
Critics.
What is Robert ... doing bad.
You know it's the...
man ain't no ... 
... our consumers gotta rock... I checked the fucking liner notes.
I started studying rock n' roll.
I can't believe it.
I studied...
... you know how heavy it is to...
he says you're intelligent.
Fuck you
I don't need you to tell me that I'm good.
Mr. Reed.
You know they say oh man ...Mr. Reed.
Fuck you.
The doorman would kiss me...
He the writer studies at Harvard...
Awkward.
... And that's the critic for the New York Times
that makes him brakes the best rock bands
at a very heavy and intelligent.
Notice that there are no coloured rock groups.
Certainly not in the New York...
He wouldn't go there man he comes to the CBGB's...
don't touch me man.
And he's a big dude. .... ....
Nice little boxes B plus.
You imagine you work for a fucking year
and you got a B plus from an asshole...
and you don't gotta take the shit.
You gotta talk to the fucking journalists.
And they get it for free. And the best seat.
.... said there's no thing we can do about it.
The club owners want a good review.
So you get the assholes right in front.
... you got some coke.
Oh what.
Anyway.
I know you're not interested in my problems.
You don't mind.

Candy came from out ...on Long Island
This is true this true believe me.
Oh wow was that true
in the backroom she's everybody's darling
....
And when she was given the greatest head
Even when she gave you the greatest head
there's nothing that Candy ever said but
Hey babe why don't you

Come on take a walk on the wild side
I really miss Candy ....
... silicon tit and I'm supposed to be...
I don't fucking do that
I mean I had health education don't put plastic in your fucking tit.
You got no heart, man. I own a heart for fourtythousand assholes.
But I got none for you. For real.
You're almost as boring as you look. Thanks.
You look like a democrat, wanna go to bed.

Hey Little Joe
Little Joe was an idiot, I don't know if any of you know that.
But here is this guy like him,
you talk to him for two measures and he has an IQ of twelve.
So like he goes - he's the only guy...
to be a movie star, it's not happening.
I mean everybody is ready go to bed with a ... OK
...barely ...undress...but it's not like that.
....
....
....
I make a Warhol film.
But you can't do that anymore man.
Candy has taken himself away from us.
And he's right now I know why he did it.
So Drella if you're there,
I'm very glad that you're around.
But man how can how.
Catherine you're there.
He went to see...
What does she do...
Late show ....
.... tries to punch him in the stomach....
Pathetic you know.
Come on man. What. You got me kidding. So many step on me man.
Go write a bible.
Anyway interesting people like Sugar Plum Fairy hit the street

Sugar Plum Fairy.
I personally love Sugar Plum Fairy.
It's terrible right.
A real terror.
She's ... from New York and corrected D... Parkers prose.
For those of you who still read.
What is...
Anyway
she makes her living writing things for the Encyclopedia Britannica.
Five cents a word....
she, Michael,
she was doing the flower section in Africa.
Delilah's... what's the word that makes this thing interesting.
We call it tiny malice.
.... oh man.
Two drinks and she ... out.
I feel ... her, like ... cigarettes on thanksgiving.
Just cause she was ... 
She wouldn't come to see me if I was dying.

Jackie
Jackie ... his revelations.
... play... ridiculous.
Ah. Started that whole thing,
I think the Rocky Horror shit and all that bullshit.
Oh man.
Don't you know I guess you don't.
It's not your fault.
It's the journalists,
those fucking journalists why don't you shoot those journalists.
You don't need those assholes,
why do you let them come in here free.
Why don't you bitch or something.
Go to another club. Yeah.
I don't believe you take the shit.
Anyway.
I will run for office next week.
And I wouldn't ...for me on a prayer.
I am not trustworthy.
Jackie and I know

She is just speeding away
Thought like me Hey I'm Jimmy Dean for a day

But you know that she had to crash
And some valium wouldn't have helped that dash
.... take... for a headache.
Eight dollars in Ohio right.
Here it's like fifty...
unless you go to Chinatown they bite your nose off
....
And then the coloured girls they work over.
Guess what they say

Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo

Wait wait,
I was gonna tell you how I came to write a song
called Walk On The Wild Side.
I did not think of it myself. Right.
That's how I got on it.
I had walked out
just when I made an album called Loaded for ....that's right.
Cause I saw it coming. I said Oh oh. Get lost. So I walked. Right.
Cause we......
so I became a typist for my old man. Forty dollars a week. Stupid.
I said yeah...but I don't want a company. You know. I had two jobs.
Once a guy on ...beach you know the stick with the pin.
Lastet one day.
... orange peel down here.
Trash, I said You gotta be kidding man
I got a stick with a pin on it.
So they put me in the pool area.
The guy who walks around
when you put your stuff like in the fucking ...
and they say If you ...
we throw it in the water.
That was an afternoon.
.... Wow I was shocked,
I was taken aback and then he saw.
So the guys who did the Threepennyopera this is all true.
Call me up they said.
We think you're a very literate rock n' roll person.
And after a day
we think you're the person that could
take Nelson Algren's book Walk On The Wild Side
and do like a musical thing for off-Broadway.
I said You gotta be kidding ..cripples in a ghetto, man.
What do you have in mind.
They said Oh but you know.
Very serious intense ... like grey hair ...
Park Avenue... oh well I'm not.. I'm a fucking typist at this point.
You gotta understand man.
People say oh Lou you're ...
I got forty dollars a week you gotta be kidding.
These assholes wanna treat me for a book that's about cripples.
I'm the best ... person to write a book about cripples in music.
Kill yourselves man.
It's better to be a garage mechanic I think.
As long as I keep thinking that I you know.
What if it wasn't true.
.... Hey schmuck.
It was really groovy all the time being a garage mechanic... oh wow.
... cause you would not listen.
...
So they say Go buy a paperback version,
they didn't give me a version.
Alright. I said it's abridged. Oh a movie with Jane Fonda.
I said Now you got it.
I like to look at Jane Fonda ...
.... I don't relate.
Backwards I don't relate.
... So I read this fucking book
and they say Will you make an X where you think the song should go.
Haha.

The cripple goes to bed. Oh yeah yeah cripple cripple.
I got ... it became a challenge.
Why don't I write the theme so I call it Walk On The Wild Side.
Oh boy Walk On The Wild Side, smart.
So I had a great time with... this stupid fucking book man.
Everybody said The guy's brilliant.
I said He's from Chicago.
... Oh
So anyway then they got Mahagony that that play that flopped.
Diana Ross getting,
Diana Ross by the way is great, as a person.
Shares many a good record at a time....
...
so anyway I had a great title
and nothing else and then they fired me. Haha.

I mean they did it very gently, they let me down easily.
They said Lou man we've got a chance to produce Mahagony....
I said Oh wow am I crushed.
Ha. ...break a leg.
... go get man advance the... Haha.
Bruce you gotta believe me man, these... people exist.
...
because assholes like Robert .. ...
and I wouldn't go in the first place.
But there I was writing this song for these assholes.
Anyway so then
I had a great time I figured
I will save this title for the day I decide to ... the world.
...
So I did then.

"Walk On The Wild Side"
(_Live_Take_No_Prisoners)


We know the rhythm, come on, eight measures of them
Don't you show any passion
You can show an emotion like a fireman
I'm not sure that we did this song all way,
like, it's not that I don't want to play your favourites,
it's just, there are so many favourites to choose from
The thing is: I, I was so sick of that song,
I don't get sick of my own songs, I like my own songs,...,
so we haven't done it in a while but, only doing tonight 
and not because I like you, because now I'm not bored with it
Everybody gets whit somebody sometimes, except me, I'm lonely
Me and my several selfs discussing at night:
Lou number one, Lou, Lou number five
Hello, is that you again reformer? Me a .... huh
Holly came from Miami F.L.A.
I had no attitude without a cigarette
I ride out cancer to be afraid of us
That wasn't a hint, I gave a remark,
coming from me, that's a compliment
Like going to bed with a brontosaurus, man, it's out of style
What is in style? Nothing is in style, man
Have you got news or not here? Why not: 'cause there's nothing
Saturdaynight man, what are you mourning
Ahaa, what returns Lou Reed before your very eyes, ah?
I do Lou Reed better than anybody, I thought I get in on it
I'm not attituded to kill every person in church
Ask them if they say eh eh
Holly came from Miami F.L.A.
hitch-hiked, hitch-hiked, oohh baby, across the U.S.A.
Plucked her eyebrows on the way
shaved his legs and he was a she
and it makes sense, you better take a walk on the wild side
Nothing to do baby what do you think I'm for on the wild side
Would you like to know how this song got written?
I know you've been dying to ask us
It sounds like Holly was born, that's an ....
Believe it or not: the first time I quit
Rock 'n roll because of too many lawsuits
It was like I could not affort my lawyers
I still can't, but now I got the goverment and it's partners
Fantastic, I get the goverment, like a week, you know,
in Puorto Rico, in a nice hotel,
and what did they play about assholes
I just play guitar
Hi Bruce
Springsteen is allright by the way
He gets my seal proved, I think he is proven
You know it's the way the critics turn on him,
like after they were on him, right?
When he needed them, they weren't there at any time
Critics: what is Robert Cristel(?) doing in bed?
You know, is he a toe fucker?
Man, ain't no retender, assume this guy to rock, what a moron
I consume this guy is rock, man, I object to the fucking liner notes
He's not studying rock 'n roll, I can't believe ...... man
I study buying me a Robert Cristel, trying to rob on him, wauw
You know how heavy it is to get reviewed by Rockwell
and he says you're intelligent, fuck you
I don't need you to tell me that I am good
Mister Reed,
you know, you say ooh man I'm just some kind of a maniac
Like in the New York Times said Mister Reed, fuck you
If you're going there then we kiss our ass now I don't give a jack
He writes and studies at Harvard though, my luck
Petite said: I quit, I thought you can't do that Nick
And that is the critic for the New York Times,
that makes and breaks the best rock bands,
that are very heavy and intelligence
Notice that there are no coloured rock groups?
certainly not in the New York writer John Roberts,
he wouldn't go there, man, he comes in CBG's for an avant-garde,
don't touch me man, and he's a big dude, someony should say:
John, don't be afraid, Cristel is like an ..... retented
Nice little boxing to B plus
You image working for a fucking year,
and you get a B plus from an asshole in the village voice?
And you don't got to take that shit,
you don't have to talk to the fucking journalists
And then get it for free in the best seats
In case you're interesting:
and there's no way we can do anything about it
The clubowners want the good review
So you get the asshole, right up front, but bored he's gone
When is this shit over, Marty, you got some coke?
Oh boy, anyway,
I know you're not interested in my problems, even mine
Candy came from out on nicer people on the island
This is true, this is true, believe me, oh why was that true
In the backroom she's everybody's darling,
went to a bar with her, ....  ... ....
And when she was giving the greatest yet,
even when she gives you the greatest head,
there's was nothing that Candy ever said but,
Hey babe, why don't you, come on take a walk on the wild side
I really miss Candy, and I even didn't know her that well
I'm such a scam artist
Bikini from a silicone tit, and I'm supposed to feel sorry?
Now don't fucking do that, don't you,
You know you have health education,
don't put plastic in your fucking tit
You got no heart: man, I don't have enough heart for 14.000 assholes
But I've got enough for you, oh really?
You're almost as boring as you look, thanks
You look like a democrat, wanna go to bed?
Hey Little Joe
Little Joe was an idiot, I don't know if any of you know that,
but, here's this guy, like it,
and you talk with him for two minutes,
you hear: he has an IQ of 12
So like he,
he's the only guy I know who went to Italy to be a moviestar,
and it is not happening,
I mean, everybody is ready to go to bed with him,
make him a star
He can't, he can't barely tie his shoes and dress,
and I know Einstein can't tie a shoe lately,
but it's not like that,
not even close man, you know he just said to what's his name
I say: Joe you're getting older, he says: I know
I make a Warhol thumb, but you can't do that anymore, man,
Andy has taken himself away from us,
and he's right, now I know why he did it
So, Drella, if you're there: I'm very glad that you're on out
But me and, how, how Catherine knew there,
he went to see Monique then, oohh
What did she do, sack?  Late show?
................. gorbedella is a what
And the nailor, yeah,
and the nailor at the party choise the punch in the stomach
is he ...... ice pathetic, you know
Come on man, say what?
You gotta be kiddin', somebody step on it man, go write a bible
Anyway, interesting people on the Sugar Plum Fairy, hit the street
Sugar Plum Fairy,
now the person who loves the Sugar Plum Fairy
is the terrible allright?
A real terror,
she's fired from the New Yorker
and corrected Dorothy Parkers proofs,
can you imaging
For those of you who still read: what a snotty remark, I know
Anyway,
she makes her living writing things for the Encyclopedia Brittanica
Five cents a word, like last time I saw her she, she,
Michael, she, she was doing the flower section in Africa
Dolites in Africa, yeah,
she said: what is the word that will make this thing interesting
We call her Tiny Malice, Dorothy Dean,
oh man, two drinks and she .... you out
I throw with dishes at her,
like filled with cigarettes on Thanksgiving
Just 'cause she was getting ready to say, mmmm
She wouldn't come to see me if I was dying
Jacky, Jacky curses, this is revalations
Remember that play, like, you know players are ridiculous?
Aahh, started that whole thing out at Rocky Horror shit
and all that bullshit
Oohh man, don't you know, and I guess you don't, it's not your fault
It's the journalists, those fucking journalists,
why don't we shoot those journalists
You don't need those assholes, why do you let them go in here free
Why don't you bitch or something, go to another club, yeah
I don't believe you take the shit
Anyway, I will run for office next week,
and I wouldn't vote for me on a prayer
I'm not trusted, but Jacky, and I know, she's just speeding away
Followed by me, hey I'm Jimmy Dean for a day, what, what
But you know that she had to crash
and some valium had helped that dash
What do I use now: Dolo..., right, ten grams for a headache
Eight, eight dollars in Ohio, right, here it is like fifteen par
Unless you go to Chinatown, they bite your nose off
Hey, you need some for pain?
And then the coloured girls, they walk over, guess what they said,
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Wait baby,
I was gone tell you how I came to write a song
Go Walk on the Wild Side
I did not think of it myself
Right, that's how I got on this one
I had worked out,
just when I made an album called Loaded For Loaded,
yeah, that's right,
because I saw it coming,
and said oh oh, get lost, so I walked, right,
because we were gonna be very succesfull,
and there could be money there and
these are my rounds
So I became a typist for my old man,
forty dollars a week, he says stupid
I said yeah, but I understood I was smart:
I don't want the company man, you know
I have had two jobs, once with a guy in Johns Beach,
you know the stick with the pin
Lasted one day, a guy threw a orange peel down here in the trash ..
I say you gotta be kiddin' man, I got a stick with a pin in it
So he put me in the pool area, the guy who walks around
when you put your stuff, like in the fucking chair
And they say:
if you even go take the stuff with you, we throw it in the water
That was an afternoon,
I said: what do you say, can't you read the sign? I was one of them
Wauw, that was, I'm a shock,
I was at war, I was taken the back, and then he saw
So, the guys who did the free pennie outward, this is all true
Call me up, of all things they say:
we think you are a very literary rock 'n roll person,
and after Ray Davies
we think that you are the person that could take Nelson Aldridge
book Walk On The Wild Side
and do like a musical thing for old Broadway
I said, I said, you gotta be kiddin',
it's about crippes in the ghetto,
man, what are you, out of your mind?
They said: oh but,you know,
very serious intensive .... like .... , Park Avenue Prize
And I said: oh what, I'm not for,
I'm a fucking typist at this point,
you gotta understand man
People saying: oh Lou you're sorry,
I got forty dollars a week, you gotta be kiddin'
These assholes wanna treat me for a book that's about cripples?
I'm the best qualified person to write a book
about cripples in music?
Kill yourself man, that's better than be a garage mechanic, I think
As long as I keep thinking that, you know, and why, what's the truth
I keep saying the ... will appear in side, hee, smuck
It was realy groovy all the time
being that garage mechanic out nightclubs, aren't they, oh wauw
Why didn't you tap my on the shoulder oh,
because you wouldn't listen,
fair enough
So they give, they,
they say go buy a paperback version and gimmie gimmie a version
I said is it writ, oh the movie with Jane Fonda,
said then: now you got it
I like to look at Jane Fonda, don't wanna hear her
Now I don't even want ot look at her, you know
I don't like the senses of lesbian pictures
Look, I, I don't relay, you know, backwards I don't relay,
and facing front is hopeless
So I read this fucking book, and I,
they said:
will you make a X where you think the song should go, haha
The cripple goes to the bathroom, oh, oh yeah, cripple cripple
I, I got jammed for a few times, I had nothing to say to them
So then it became a challenge, so I figured,
why don't I write the theme song for Walk On The Wild Side,
I call it Walk On The Wild Side, that's smart
So I had a great time with nothing to write about,
this stupid fucking book,man
Everybody says the guy is brilliant, I said: he's from Chicago,
Saul Bellow, oh
So anyway, then they got Mahogony, that, that play that flopped
Diana Ross getting,
Diana Ross by the way is great, as a person,
she hasn't any good record at the time
Love Hangover is not
She says lo... that's more than you do
So anyway, I had a great title,
and nothing else, and then they fired me
I mean they did it really gently,
they looked down easily and they said:
Lou, man, we've got a chanche to produce Mahogony on Broadway
I said: ow wauw, am I crushed,
ha, break a leg, I read that book, go get them man, look
advance the theatre, haha,
Bruce, you got to believe me man, these, these people excist
Till the play ba...
because assholes like Robert Cristel said it was terrible,
and in this case it was
And I wouldn't go in the first place,
but there I was writing the song for these assholes
Anyway, so then, I had a great time writing, I figured
I save this title for the day I decide to solve the world
New .. .... so I did them

Here's a trifling correction concerning Walk On The Wild Side,
the Take No Prisoners version.

"Robert Christel" should be "Robert Christgau" and
"Nelson Aldridge" should be "Nelson Algren".

OK, here is the definitive version of Lou Reed's
Walk on the Wild Side from "Take No Prisoner's".
I sat for quite awhile,
but I corrected all the past errors that I had seen.
Hope this helps
and thank you so much for the best site on Lou on the web!!

Sorry Micheal, We had some kind of a nut here the other night night.
There's no place to put the fucking glass so I
I put it on the floor
because I didn't want to get the fucking Yamaha Piano dirty
cause it costs so fucking much.
There's a lunatic out there he comes after the show,
says I want to talk to that fucking Reed man
why did he throw a cup at his roadie.
Five cops and he hits a cop. Can you imagine? What an asshole!
Hey and he had his brother here right and he punches a cop.
I want to talk to Lou about the ...answer to life
and why your booing me...
so next time you're wondering.
And I don't live that far from here...like I get out of the limo
and there'll be the dragon with the cape
and all your sins and then some
and I'll say, Yeah, but I'm not Catholic, Jack.
The umbrella man is on Riker's Island
and he's studying to be a dentist.
You remember him? With the cape?
(audience member yells out "LOU!" and he answers)

What?
Surprised ya, huh. What do you think this is? Question and Answer?
It's not my fault man.

Twenty thousand years of rock man come on...
I don't have anything to say
I just want it quiet, man, I've been here for a week.
You think that's an accomplishment?
I think it's a ...something you're sentenced to!
And if you don't get that, you get the pladium with dulcimer...
two hours for fourty thousand animals throwing beer cans at you...
oh but that's rock n' roll
bullshit. Not behind my back it ain't.


We know the rhythm, come on, eight measures of them
Don't you show any passion
You show an emotion I fire you!
I'm not sure that we did this song all week,
like, it's not that I don't want to play your favourites,
it's just, there are so many favourites to choose from (so)
The thing is: I, I was so sick of that song,
I don't get sick of my own songs, I like my own songs,...,
so we haven't done it in a while but, only doing tonight
and not because I like it, because now I'm not bored with it
Everybody gets bored with somebody sometimes, except me, I'm lonely
Me and my several selves discuss it at night:
Lou number one, Lou, Lou number five
Hello, is that you again reformer? Mea .Culpa... huh
Holly came from Miami F.L.A. Oh man, sorry.
I have no attitude without a cigarette
I'd rather have cancer than be a fag
That wasn't an anti-gay remark
coming from me, that's a compliment
It's Like going to bed with a brontosaurus, man, it's out of style
What is in style? Nothing is in style, man
Have you gotten into nothing? Why not: 'cause there's nothing
Saturday night man, what do you want?
Ahaa, Watch me turn into Lou Reed before your very eyes, ah?
I do Lou Reed better than anybody, I thought I get in on it
Enough attitude to kill every person in Jersey
Ask them in Passaic
Holly came from Miami F.L.A.
hitch-hiked, hitch-hiked, oohh baby, across the U.S.A.
Plucked her eyebrows on the way
shaved his legs and he was a she
and it makes sense, you better take a walk on the wild side
Nothing to do baby what do you think I'm for on the wild side

Would you like to know how this song got written?
I know you've been dying to ask us
That sound like Hollywood to you Mark?, that's an inside joke ....
Believe it or not: the first time I quit
Rock 'n roll because of too many lawsuits
It was like I could not afford my lawyers
I still can't, but now I got the government as partners
Fantastic, I get the government, like a week, you know,
in Puerto Rico, in a nice hotel,
It's like what are you complaining about assholes
I just play guitar
Hi Bruce
Springsteen is allright by the way
He gets my seal of approval, I think he's groovy
You notice the way the critics turned on him,
like after they were on him, right?
When he needed them, they weren't there at any time
Critics: what is Robert Christgau do in bed?
You know, is he a toe fucker?
Man, anal retentive, "a consumer's guide to rock?!?", what a moron
a consumer's guide to rock, man, I object to the fucking liner notes
He's starts studying rock 'n roll,
I can't believe .....Baroche rock. man
A study by me a Robert Christgau, And John Rockwell, man, wauw
You know how heavy it is to get reviewed by Rockwell
and he says you're intelligent, fuck you
I don't need you to tell me that I am good
Mister Reed,
you know, you say ooh man I'm just some kind of a maniac
Like in the New York Times said Mister Reed, fuck you
Your doorman wouldn't kiss my ass now I don't give a jack
He, right, he studies at Harvard though, monologue
But dig this: Opera. He's a fucking opera guy!
And that is the critic for the New York Times,
that makes and breaks the best rock bands,
that are very heavy and intelligence
Notice that there are no coloured rock groups?
certainly not in the New York Times with John Rockwell,
he wouldn't go there, man, he comes to CBGB's with an armed guard,
don't touch me man, and he's a big dude, someony should say:
John, don't be afraid, Christgau is like an anal retentive
Nice little box and a B plus
CanYou image working for a fucking year,
and you get a B plus from an asshole in the village voice?
And you don't got to take that shit,
you don't have to talk to the fucking journalists
And they get it for free and the best seats
In case you're interesting:
and there's no way we can do anything about it
The club owners want the good review
So you get the asshole, right up front, but bored he's gone
When is this shit over, Marty, you got some coke?
Oh boy, anyway,
I know you're not interested in my problems, neither am I
Candy came from out on Massapequa, Long island
This is true, this is true, believe me, oh wow was that true
In the backroom she's everybody's darling,

And when she was giving the greatest head,
even when she gives you the greatest head,
there's was nothing that Candy ever said but,
Hey babe, why don't you, come on take a walk on the wild side
I really miss Candy, and I even didn't know her that well
I'm such a scam artist
Leukemia from a silicone tit, and I'm supposed to feel sorry?
Now don't fucking do that, don't you,
You know you have health education,
don't put plastic in your fucking tit
You got no heart: man, I don't have enough heart for 14.000 assholes
But I've got enough for you, oh really?
You're almost as boring as you look, thanks
You look like a democrat, wanna go to bed?

He can't, he can't barely tie his shoes and dress,
and I know Einstein can't tie his shoe laces,

not even close man, you know he just sits and wants a name
I say: Joe you're getting older, he says: I know
I'll make a Warhol film, but you can't do that anymore, man,
Andy has taken himself away from us,
and he's right, now I know why he did it
So, Drella, if you're there: I'm very glad that you're around
But me and, how, how Catherine you're there,

What did she do, sag? Late show?
Mamie Von Doren, she has Gore Vidal as a what? Him and Mailer.
And the Mailer, yeah,
I met Mailer at a party and he tries to punch you in the stomach
To see how tough you are ...... he's pathetic, you know
Come on man, say what?
You gotta be kiddin', somebody step on it man, go write a bible
Anyway, interesting people like the Sugar Plum Fairy, hit the street
Sugar Plum Fairy,
now the person who loves the Sugar Plum Fairy
is the terrible right?
A real terror,
she's fired from the New Yorker
for correcting Dorothy Parkers prose,
can you imagine
For those of you who still read: what a snotty remark, I know
Anyway,
she makes her living writing things for the Encyclopedia Brittanica
Five cents a word, like last time I saw her she, she,
Michael, she, she was doing the flower section in Africa
Delilah's Nabula, yeah,
she said: what is the word that will make this thing interesting
We call her Tiny Malice, Dorothy Dean,
oh man, two drinks and she lays this dude out
I throw a dish at her,
like filled with cigarettes on Thanksgiving
Just 'cause she was getting ready to say, mmmm
She wouldn't come to see me if I was dying
Jackie, Jackie Curtis, this is revalations
Remember that play, like, you know that play that was so ridiculous?
Aahh, started that whole thing now you got that Rocky Horror shit
and all that bullshit
Oohh man, don't you know, and I guess you don't, it's not your fault
It's the journalists, those fucking journalists,
why don't we shoot those journalists
You don't need those assholes, why do you let them go in here free
Why don't you bitch or something, go to another club, yeah
I don't believe you take this shit
Anyway, I will run for office next week,
and I wouldn't vote for me on a prayer
I'm not trustworthy, Jacky, and I know, she's just speeding away
Though like me, hey I'm Jimmy D for a day, what, what
But you know that she had to crash
and some valium had helped that bash
What do I use now: Dilaudid..., right, ten grains for a headache
Eight, eight dollars in Ohio, right, here it is like fifty-five
Unless you go to Chinatown, they bite your nose off
Hey, you need somethinh for pain?
And then the coloured girls, they walk over, guess what they said,
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Wait baby,
I was gone tell you how I came to write a song
Called Walk on the Wild Side
I did not think of it myself
Right, that's how I got on this one
I had worked out,
just when I made an album called Loaded For Loaded with hits,
yeah, that's right,
because I saw it coming,
and said oh oh, get lost, so I walked, right,
because we were gonna be very succesfull,
and there could be money there and it's tyranic
So I became a typist for my old man,
forty dollars a week, he says stupid
I said yeah, but I understood I was smart:
I don't want the company man, you know
I have had two jobs, one's with a guy in Jones Beach,
you know the stick with the pin
Lasted one day, a guy threw a orange peel down here in the trash ..
I say you gotta be kiddin' man, I got a stick with a pin in it
So he put me in the pool area, the guy who walks around
when you put your stuff, like in the fucking chair
And they say:
if you leave, and don't take the stuff with you,
we throw it in the water
That was an afternoon,
I said: what do you say, can't you read the sign? I was one of them
Wauw, that was, I'm a shock,
I was appalled, I was taken the back, and then he saw
So, the guys who did the Three Penny Opera, this is all true
Call me up, of all things they say:
we think you are a very literary rock 'n roll person,
and after Ray Davies
we think that you are the person that could take Nelson Algren's
book Walk On The Wild Side
and do like a musical thing for off-Broadway
I said, I said, you gotta be kiddin',
it's about cripples in the ghetto,
man, what are you, out of your mind?
They said: oh but,you know,
very serious intense hippies like,
40-ish grey haired, Italian, ,like,
Park Avenue apartment
And I said: oh what, I'm not for,
I'm a fucking typist at this point,
you gotta understand man
People saying: oh Lou you're so nice,
I got forty dollars a week, you gotta be kiddin'
These assholes wanna treat me for a book that's about cripples?
I'm the best qualified person to write a book
about cripples in music?
Kill yourself man, that's better than be a garage mechanic, I think
As long as I keep thinking that, you know, and why, what's the truth
I keep saying the Genie will appear and say: "hey, schmuck!
It was really groovy all the time
being that garage mechanic out in Islip", and I'll say "Oh, wow"
Why didn't you tap my on the shoulder earlier,
because you wouldn't have listened,
fair enough
So they give, they,
they say go buy a paperback version,
they didn't even give me a version
I said is it abridged?, oh the movie with Jane Fonda,
said then: now you got it
I like to look at Jane Fonda, don't wanna hear her
Now I don't even want ot look at her, you know
I don't like sensitive lesbian pictures
Look, I, I don't relate, you know, backwards I don't relate,
and facing front is hopeless
So I read this fucking book, and I,
they said:
will you make a X where you think the song should go, haha
The cripple goes to the bathroom, oh, oh yeah, cripple cripple
I, I got jammed for a few times, I had nothing to say to them
So then it became a challenge, so I figured,
why don't I write the theme song for Walk On The Wild Side,
I call it Walk On The Wild Side, that's smart
So I had a great title with nothing to write about,
this stupid fucking book, man
Everybody says the guy is brilliant, I said: he's from Chicago,
Saul Bellow, oh
So anyway, then they got Mahogony, that, that play that flopped
Diana Ross getting,
Diana Ross by the way is great, as a person,
she hasn't made a good record in a time
Love Hangover is not
She says hello to me, that's more than you do
So anyway, I had a great title,
and nothing else, and then they fired me
I mean they did it really gently,
they looked down easily and they said:
Lou, man, we've got a chance to produce Mahogony off Broadway
I said: ow wauw, am I crushed,
ha, break a leg, I read that in the book, go get them man, look
advance the theatre, haha,
Bruce, you got to believe me man, these, these people exist
Till the play bombed
because assholes like Robert Christgau said it was terrible,
and in this case it was
And I wouldn't go on in the first place,
but there I was writing the song for these assholes
Anyway, so then, I had a great title and, I figured
I save this title for the day I decide to assault the world
You yawn .. .... so I did some.

you have:

"Holly came from Miami F.L.A.

I have no attitude without a cigarette.
I rather have ... than be a faggot so.
That was an .... remark coming from me.
Like going to bed with a... it's out of style.
What's in style. Nothing is in style man..."


I believe it says:

"I have no attitude without a cigarette
I'd rather have cancer than be a faggot
That wasn't an anti-gay remark coming from me
It's like going to bed with a Brontosaurus-it's outta style
What's in style? Nothing is in style, man"

"Warrior King - Revenge"
========================
album _Magic And Loss_
(Lou Reed, 1992)

written by Lou Reed
========================


        I wish I was the warrior king
        in every language that I speak
        Lord over all that I survey
        and all that I see I keep
        Power omnipresent
        undiminished uncontrolled
        With a message violent fury
        at the center of my soul

        I wish I was a warrior king
        inscrutable benign
        With a faceless charging power
        always at my command
        Footsteps so heavy that the world shakes
        my rage instilling fear, ah-huh
        Yet cautious firm but fair and good
        the perfect warrior king

        I wish I installed angels
        in every subject's house
        Agents of my goodness
        no one would be without
        A steak on every plate
        a car for every house
        And if you ever crossed me
        I'd have your eyes put out

        You don't exist without me
        without me you don't exist
        And if logic won't convince you
        then there's always this
        I'm bigger, smarter, stronger, tough
        yet sensitive and kind
        And though I could crush you like a bug
        it would never cross my mind

        It wouldn't cross my mind to break your neck
        or rip out your vicious tongue
        It wouldn't cross my mind to snap your leg like a twig
        or squash you like some slug
        You are a violent messenger
        and I'm not above your taunts
        And if you hit me, you know I'll kill you
        because I'm the warrior king

"Waves Of Fear"
=====================
album _The Blue Mask_
(Lou Reed, 1982)

written by Lou Reed
=====================


        Waves of fear, attack in the night
        waves of revulsion, sickening sights
        My heart's nearly bursting, my chest's choking tight

        Waves of fear, waves of fear

        Waves of fear, squat on the floor
        looking for some pill, the liquor is gone
        Blood drips from my nose, I can barely breathe
        waves of fear, I'm too scared to leave

        Waves of fear, waves of fear
        waves of fear, waves of fear

        I'm too afraid to use the phone
        I'm too afraid to put the light on
        I'm so afraid I've lost control
        I'm suffocating without a word

        Crazy with sweat, spittle on my jaw
        what's that funny noise, what's that on the floor
        Waves of fear, pulsing with death
        I curse my tremors, I jump at my own step
        I cringe at my terror, I hate my own smell
        I know where I must be, I must be in hell

        Waves of fear, waves of fear
        waves of fear, waves of fear

album _Wild Angel_
(Nelson Slater, 1976)

written by Nelson Slater

Lou Reed:

=========================================


        If I could see the firm young face
        you used to wear
        As I can almost see it now
        yet I am painfully aware
        Of letting you decide
        knowing well I should have tried
        To dry those tears that always seemed
        to cloud your eyes
        For then the truth would make you free
        to realize

        We built our nest
        in a falling tree
        We did our best
        to make you and me

        To make you and me
        we
        To make our names agree

        We sold our lives
        to an enemy
        As soon as we tried
        to make you and me

        To make you and me
        we
        You and I could never be

        We

        If there could be a way for frozen
        love to thaw
        If there could be and endless source
        from which to draw

        The strength to set things right
        there still would be a plight
        Too great for either of our hardened
        hearts to bear
        And in the end the bitter truth
        would still be there

        We built our nest
        in a falling tree
        We did our best
        to make you and me

        To make you and me
        we
        To make our names agree
        woh, wow-wow

        We sold our lives
        to an enemy
        As soon as we tried
        to make you and me

        To make you and me
        we
        You and I could never be

        We

        we

        Of letting you decide
        knowing well I should have tried
        To dry those tears that always seemed
        to cloud your eyes
        For then the truth would make you free
        to realize

        If there could be a way for frozen (WE SOLD OUR LIVES)
        love to thaw (TO AN ENEMY)
        If there could be and endless source (WE SOLD OUR LIVES)
        from which to draw (TO AN ENEMY)

        The strength to set things right (WE SOLD OUR LIVES)
        there still would be a plight (TO AN ENEMY)
        Too great for either of our hardened (WE SOLD OUR LIVES)
        hearts to bear (TO AN ENEMY)
        And in the end the bitter truth (WE SOLD OUR LIVES)
        would still be there (TO AN ENEMY)

        I see trees of green, red roses too
        I see them bloom for me and you
        And I think to myself
        what a wonderful world

        I see skies of blue and clouds of white
        the bright blessed day, the dark sacred night
        And I think to myself, mmmm..
        what a wonderful world

        The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
        are also on the faces of people going by
        I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do
        they're really saying I love you

        Well I hear babies crying, I watch them grow
        they'll learn much more than I'll ever know
        And I think to myself, mmmm..
        what a wonderful world

        Sleep mi bebe, we are all here
        buscando la luz in the city
        so that you may here the ....

"What Becomes A Legend Most"
============================
album _New Sensations_
(Lou Reed, 1984)

written by Lou Reed
============================


        What becomes a legend most
        when she's alone in a hotel lobby
        What becomes a legend most
        some bad champagne and some foreign bottled beer

        What becomes a legend most
        when the musicians have come and then leave her
        What becomes a legend most
        besides being a legendary star

        What becomes a legend most
        lying in bed cold and regal
        What becomes a legend most
        lying in bed watching a talk show on TV

        What becomes a legend most
        fifty days in fifty cities
        And everyone says she looks pretty
        at least as pretty as a legend should

        Fifty days can wear you down
        fifty cities flying by
        A different man in each different hotel
        and if you're not careful word can get around

        What becomes a legend most
        not a bed that is half-empty
        Not a heart that is left empty
        that's not pretty, not pretty at all

        What becomes a legend most
        when she's lying in her hotel room
        What becomes a legend most
        well baby, tonight it's you (tonight it's you)
        Baby, tonight it's you

        (What becomes a legend most, sha-la-la-la-la) Baby, it's you
        (what becomes a legend most, sha-la-la-la-la) maybe tomorrow
        (What becomes a legend most, sha-la-la-la-la) Baby, it's you
        (what becomes a legend most, sha-la-la-la-la)
        (What becomes a legend most, sha-la-la-la-la)
        (what becomes a legend most, sha-la-la-la-la)
        (What becomes a legend most, sha-la-la-la-la)

tiny detail:
I think the A#(on F) chord in "What becomes a legend most"
should actually be Fm6 (i.e. F-Ab-C-D).
I might be mistaken, but it sounds better (at least on piano)


---------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------
thanks: Bert Timmermans (bonzothegod@hotmail.com)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

furthermore, at the end of what becomes a legend most,
{D#m} {A#/Gm} {Cm7/F}
{A#/Gm} {Cm7/F}
(or, more specifically, the Cm7 is actually Cm7.Cm)

"What Goes On"

written by Lou Reed
==============================


        What goes on here in your mind
        I think that I am falling down
        What goes on here in your mind
        I think that I am upside down

        Lady be good and do what you should
        you know it'll work alright
        Lady be good and do what you should
        you know it'll be alright

        I'm going up and I'm going down
        I'm gonna fly from side to side
        See the bells up in the sky
        somebody's cut the string in two

        Lady be good and do what you should
        you know it'll work alright
        Lady be good and do what you should
        you know it'll be alright

        One minute one, one minute two
        one minute up and one minute down
        What goes on here in your mind
        I think that I am falling down

        Lady be good and do what you should

thanks: Tim (Tim@snsys.com)

Your site doesn't have the solo for What Goes On
by the Velvet Underground,
so here is my attempt at it.
I didn't realise it was sposed to be downtuned
so I have done it in Standard Tuning.
If downtuned, simply play the same thing 2 frets higher!

This was done by listening to the live version from the Box Set.

The version on the record
is lots of takes of the same solo mixed together.


I'm doing this from memory, so it may be a bit wrong.

"What's Good"
==================================
album _Until The End Of The World_
(Original Soundtrack, 1991)

written by Lou Reed
==================================


        Life's like a mayonnaise soda
        and life's like space without room
        And life's like bacon and ice cream
        that's what life's like without you

        Life's like forever becoming, but -
        - life's forever dealing in hurt
        Now life's like death without living
        that's what life's like without you

        Life's like Sanskrit read to a pony
        I see you in my mind's eye strangling on your tongue
        What good is knowing such devotion
        I've been around, huh, I know what makes things run

        What good is seeing eye chocolate
        what good's a computerized nose
        And what good was cancer in April
        why no good, no good at all

        What good's a war without killing
        what good is rain that falls up
        What good's a disease that won't hurt you
        why no good, I guess, no good at all

        What good are these thoughts that I'm thinking
        It must be better, huh, not to be thinking at all
        A styrofoam lover with emotions of concrete
        no not much, not much at all

        What good is life without living
        what good's this lion that barks
        You loved a life others throw away nightly
        it's not fair, huh, not fair at all

        What's good
        oh baby, what's good
        What's good
        what's good, not much at all

        Hey baby, what's good (what's good)
        What's good (what's good)
        what's good (what's good), not much at all

        What's good (what's good)
        what's good (life's good)
        Life's good (life's good)
        what's good (life's good), but not fair at all

========================


        I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
        Just like the ones I used to know
        Where those treetops, ah, they glisten
        and oh, oh children listen
        To hear sleigh bells in the snow

        Bi-yu-bi-du-wah, I-I-I-I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
        With every Christmas card that I write
        May your days be, your days be
        your days be happy and bright, ooohhh
        And may all your Christmases be white

        Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle all the way

        There's a white prism with phony jism
        spread across its face
        and the soulful convicts forever interred
        lose the smile across their faces
        The smile that registered hopes or dreams
        has proven just a waste

        And I'm the indentured servant
        forever in his place
        I'm the indentured servant
        forever in his place

        I wish I built a cabinet
        of shiny bolts and wood
        secret draws and hiding places
        sculpted out of wood
        Secret places, secret lies
        in a desk lying alone

        A secret letter written to you
        to be read when you're alone
        A secret letter written to you
        to be read when you're alone

        It says, I'm your indentured servant
        I can no longer pretend
        that I'm a lover or an equal
        I'm not even a friend
        I'm not good enough to serve you
        I'm not good enough to stay

        So it is that I beseech you
        to please turn me away
        so it is that I beseech you
        to please turn me away

        Turn me away
        turn me away
        turn me away

        I'm asking you to let me go
        it hurts me when you're sad
        and I can not do better than this
        which must surely make you mad
        I'd be better off in your cabinet
        or in a prison made of cloth

        Crouched beneath your dress I come
        shooting little spurts
        crouched beneath your dress I come
        shooting little spurts

        I'm your indentured servant
        but even I have pride
        in what I make or say or do
        although I've lots to hide
        I hide from freedom and I hide from you
        'cause you've found me out

        I belong in prison beneath your legs
        in a cabinet that I've built
        beneath a candle in a secret drawer
        in a prison by a moat

        I'm your indentured servant
        and I'm asking you to leave
        me outside this prison cell
        where only you can breathe
        I-I-I, I'm your indentured servant
        but I'm asking you for this

        Please release me from this love
        and do it with a kiss
        I'm your indentured servant
        I'm the one you'll miss

        Do it with a kiss
        do it with a kiss
        do it with a kiss
        I'm the one you'll miss

not just lyrics I copied from the booklet.



White prism
------------
There's a white prism with phony jism
Spread across its face
And the soulful convicts forever interred
Lose the smile across their faces
The smile that registered hopes or dreams
Has proven just a waste
And I'm the indentured servant
Forever in his place
I'm the indentured servant
Forever in his place

I wish I built a cabinet of shiny bolts and wood
Secret draws and hiding places sculpted out of wood
Secret places secret lies in a desk lying alone
A secret letter written to you
To be read when you're alone
A secret letter written to you
To be read when you're alone

It says:
I'm your indentured servant
I can no longer pretend
That I'm a lover or an equal
I'm not even a friend
I'm not good enough to serve you
I'm not good enough to stay
So it is that I beseech you
To please turn me away
So it is that I beseech you
To please turn me away
Turn me away
Turn me away
Turn me away

I'm asking you to let me go
It hurts me when you're sad
And I can not do better than this
Which must surely make you mad
I'd be better off in your cabinet
or in a prison made of cloth
Crouched beneath your dress I come
Shooting little spurts
Crouched beneath your dress I come
Shooting little spurts

I'm your indentured servant
But even I have pride
In what I make or say or do
Although I've lots to hide
I hide from freedom and I hide from you
'cause you've found me out
I belong in prison beneath your legs
In a cabinet that I've built
Beneath a candle in a secret drawer
in a prison by a moat

I'm your indentured servant
And I'm asking you to leave
Me outside this prison cell where only you can breathe

I'm your indentured servant but I'm asking you for this
Please release me from this love and do it with a kiss
I'm your indentured servant
I'm the one you'll miss
Do it with a kiss
Do it with a kiss
Do it with a kiss
I'm the one you'll miss

"Who Am I? (Tripitena's Song)"
==============================
album _The Raven_
(Lou Reed, 2003)

written by Lou Reed

produced by Ric Wake
==============================


        Sometimes I wonder who am I
        the world seeming to pass me by
        A younger man now getting old
        I have to wonder what the rest of life will hold

        I hold a mirror to my face
        there are some lines that I could trace
        To memories of loving you
        the passion that breaks reason in two

        I have to think and stop me now
        if reminisces make you frown
        One thinks of what one hoped to be
        and then faces reality

        Sometimes I wonder who am I
        who made the trees, who made the sky
        Who made the storms, who made heartbreak
        I wonder how much life I can take

        I know I like to dream a lot
        and think of other worlds that are not
        I hate that I need air to breathe
        I'd like to leave this body and be free

        I'd like to float like a mystic child
        I'd like to kiss an angel on the brow
        I'd love to solve the mysteries of life
        by cutting someone's throat or removing their heart

        You'd like to see it beat
        you'd like to hold your eyes
        And though you know I'm dead
        you'd like to hold my thighs

        If it's wrong to think on this
        to hold the dead past in your fist
        Why were we given memories
        let us lose our minds and be set free

        Some-, sometimes I, I wonder who am I
        the world seeming to pass me by
        A younger man now getting old
        I have to wonder what the rest of life will hold

        I wonder
        I wonder -

        - Ooohhh, who started all this
        was God in love and gave a kiss
        To someone who later betrayed
        and Godless love sent us away

        To someone who later betrayed
        and Godless love sent us away

(alternate version)

(Lou Reed, 2003)

produced by Lou Reed/Hal Willner
================================


        Sometimes I wonder who am I
        the world seeming to pass me by
        A younger man now getting old
        I have to wonder what the rest of life will hold

        I hold a mirror to my face
        there are some lines that I could trace
        To memories of loving you
        a passion that breaks reason in two

        I, I, I have to think and, I have to think and stop me now
        if reminisces make you frown
        One thinks of what one hoped to be
        and then faces reality

        I wonder who started all this
        was God in love and gave a kiss
        To someone who later betrayed
        and Godless love sent us away

        Sometimes I wonder who am I
        who made the trees, who made the sky
        Who made the storms, who made heartbreak
        I wonder how much life I can take

        I see at last a future self
        were you alive I'd ask your help
        But thinking puts me in a daze
        and thinking never helped me anyway

        You always were so negative
        you never saw the positive
        You always stand upon the edge
        and dream of what it must be to be dead

        I know I like to dream a lot
        and think of other worlds that are not
        I hate that I need air to breathe
        I'd like to leave this body and be free

        You'd like to float like a mystic child
        you'd like to kiss an angel on the brow
        You'd love to solve the mystery of life

        you'd like to hold my thighs

        If it's wrong to think on this
        to hold the dead past, to hold the dead past in your fist
        Why were we, why were we given memories
        let us lose our minds, be set free

        Sometimes I wonder who am I
        the world seeming to pass me by
        A younger man now getting old
        I have to wonder what the rest of life will hold

        I wonder
        I wonder -

        - Who started all this, ooohhh
        was God in love and, was God in love and gave a kiss
        To someone who later betrayed
        and Godless love sent us away

        To someone who later betrayed
        Godless love sent us away
        To someone who later betrayed
        Godless love sent us away

"Who Am I"
=======================================
unreleased live
(Lou Reed, 2000)

* written for the play _POE-try_ (2000)
(collaboration with Robert Wilson)

Apr 24, 2000
Phillipshalle, Dusseldorf, Germany
=======================================


        Sometimes I wonder who am I
        the world seeming to pass me by
        A younger man now getting old
        I have to wonder what the rest of life will hold

        I hold the mirror to my face
        there are some lines that I could trace
        To memories of loving you
        the passion that breaks reason in two

        I have to think and stop me now
        if reminisces make you frown
        One thinks of what one hoped to be
        and then faces reality

        I wonder who started all this
        was God in love and gave a kiss
        To someone who later betrayed
        and Godless love sent us away

        Sometimes I wonder who am I
        who made the trees, who made the sky
        Who made the storms, who made heartbreak
        I wonder how much life I can take

        I see at last a future self
        were you alive I'd ask your help
        But thinking, but thinking puts me in a daze
        and thinking never helped me anyway

        You always were so negative
        you always stared upon the edge
        --- [bass] ---
        and dream of what it must be to be dead

        I know I like to dream a lot
        and think of other worlds that are not
        I hate that I need air to breathe
        I'd like to leave this body and be free

        I'd like to float like a mystic child
        I'd like to kiss an angel on the brow
        I'd like to solve the mystery of life
        by cutting someone's throat or removing their heart

        You'd like so see it beat
        you'd like to hold your eyes
        And though you know I'm dead
        you'd like to hold my thighs

        If it's wrong to think of this
        to hold the dead past in your fist
        Why were we given the memories
        let us lose our minds and be set free

        Sometimes I wonder who am I
        the world seeming to pass me by
        A younger man now getting old
        I have to wonder what the rest of life will hold

        I wonder
        I wonder -

        - Who started this
        was God in love and gave a kiss
        To someone who later betrayed
        and Godless love sent us away

        To someone who later betrayed
        and Godless love sent us away

Who Am I?
(Lou Reed)

Sometimes I wonder who am I
The world seeming to pass me by
A younger man now getting old
I have to wonder what the rest of life will hold
I hold the mirror to my face
There are some lines that I could trace
To memories of loving you
The passion that breaks reason in two
I have to think and stop me now
These reminisces make you frown
One thinks of what one hoped to be
And then faces reality
I wonder who started all this
Was god in love and gave a kiss
To who someone who later betrayed
And godless love sent us away
Sometimes I wonder who am I
Who made the trees who made the sky
Who made the storms who made heartbreak
I wonder how much life I can take
I see at last a future self
With you oh life I ask you help
But thinking but thinking puts me in a day
And thinking never helped me anyway
You always were so negative
You always stared upon the edge
And dreamed of what it must be to be dead
I know I like to dream a lot
And think of other worlds that are not
I hate that I need air to breathe
I'd like to leave this body and be free
I'd like to float like a mystic child
I'd like to kiss an angel on the brow
I'd like to solve the mystery of life
Like cutting someone's ... removing their heart
You like so see it beat
You like to hold your eye
And though you know I'm dead
You like to hold my ...
As if is wrong think of this
To hold the death as in your fist
Why were we given the memories
That all lose are minds and set free
Sometimes I wonder who am I
The world seeming to pass me by
A younger man now getting old
I have to wonder what the rest of life will hold
I wonder
I wonder
I wonder who started this
Was god in love and gave a kiss
To someone who later betrayed
And godless love sent us away
To someone who later betrayed
And godless love sent us away

"Why Can't I Be Good"
===========================
album _Faraway, So Close!_
(Original Soundtrack, 1993)

written by Lou Reed
===========================


        Why can't I be good
        why can't I act like a man
        why can't I be good
        and do what other men can
        Why can't I be good
        make something of this life
        if I can't be a god
        let me be more than a wife

        Why can't I be good
        why can't I be good
        Why can't I be good
        why can't I be good

        I don't want to be weak
        I want to be strong
        not a fat happy weakling
        with two useless arms
        A mouth that keeps moving
        with nothing to say
        an eternal baby
        who never moved away

        Why can't I be good
        why can't I be good
        Why can't I be good
        why can't I be good

        I'd like to look in the mirror
        with a feeling of pride
        instead of seeing a reflection
        of failure a crime
        I don't want to turn away
        to make sure I cannot see
        I don't want to hold my ears
        when I think about me

        Why can't I be good
        why can't I be good
        Why can't I be good
        why can't I be good

        I want to be like the wind
        when it uproots a tree
        carries it across an ocean
        to plant in a valley
        I want to be like the sun
        that makes it flourish and grow
        I don't want to be
        what I am anymore

        Why can't I be good
        why can't I be good
        Why can't I be good
        why can't I be good

        I was thinking of some kind of whacked out syncopation
        that would help improve this song
        some knock 'em down rhythm
        that would help it move along
        Some rhyme of pure perfection
        a beat so hard and strong
        if I can't get it right this time
        will a next time come along

        Why can't I be good
        why can't I be good
        Why can't I be good
        why can't I be good

On your site you say you need the words to
Why Dont You Smile Now, by Reed and Cale
from before the Velvet Underground.

This was transcribed by me from listening to a cover of the song
by the band Spiritualised.
I think the words are the same,
but Spiritualised might have added an extended chorus at the end!



You didn't care when I begged you to stay
why don't you smile now
You laughed at me and then you walked away
why don't you smile now

Why don't you smile yeah, smile woah
Smile yeah, smile woah
Why dont you smile now

You said he could give you much more than me
why don't you smile now
You said he could give you everything you need
why don't you smile now

Why don't you smile yeah, smile woah
Smile yeah, smile woah
Why dont you smile now

Sequined dress and high heeled shoes
but baby all you got was blues
why dont you smile now
Now you're back you want back in
but baby you just watch me grin
why dont you smile now

Why don't you smile yeah, smile woah
Smile yeah, smile woah
Smile yeah, smile woah
Smile yeah, smile woah
Smile yeah, smile woah
Smile yeah, smile woah
Why dont you smile

Smile yeah ooh y dont u smile
ooh why dont u smile
Smile yeah ooh y dont u smile yeah

Smile yeah, smile woah
Smile yeah, smile woah
Smile yeah, smile woah
Smile yeah, smile woah
Smile yeah, smile woah
Smile yeah, smile woah
Smile yeah, smile woah
(fade out)



Hope that helps.

2nd Verse should be:

Fancy talk, cadillac car
but your love didn't get you far
why don't you smile now?

        Why do you talk
        why do you waste time
        saying the same old thing
        it should be a crime

        You never listen
        instead you stammer

        As though you're interesting
        and full of glamour
        as though you're interesting
        and full of glamour

        Why do you talk so much
        why don't you shut up
        you have nothing to say
        you lack drama

        It's the same old thing
        you'd like to know why

        Who made the earth move
        who made the sky high
        who made the earth move
        who made the sky high

        Who made your blood red
        who made you think thoughts
        who made you breathe a breath
        tell me why do you talk
        Oh, tell me why do you talk
        tell me why do you talk
        tell me why do you talk

        Why do you always talk
        why do you make sound

        Why don't you listen
        why do you talk so much
        why don't you listen
        why do you talk so much
        Why don't you shut up
        why don't you shut up
        why don't you shut up
        why do you talk so much

My own interpretation like always.


Why do you talk


Why do you talk
Why do you waste time
Saying the same old thing
You should be a crime
You never listen
Instead you stammer
As though you're interesting
And full of glamour
As though you're interesting
And full of glamour.

Why do you talk so much
Why don't you shut up
You have nothing to say
You like drama
It's the same old thing
You'd like to know why
Who makes the earth move
Who make the sky high
Who make the earth move
Who make the sky high

Who make your blood red
Who make you think thoughts
Who make you breathe the breath
Tell me why do you talk
Oh, tell me why do you talk
Tell me why do you talk
Tell me why do you talk
Why do you always talk
Why do you make sound
Why don't you listen
Why do you talk so much
Why don't you listen 

why do you talk so much
why don't you shut up
why don't you shut up
why don't you shut up
why do you talk so much

"Wild Angel"
========================
album _Wild Angel_
(Nelson Slater, 1976)

written by Nelson Slater

Lou Reed:
produce, piano, guitar
========================


        You've entered the magic kingdom
        great goodbye gambler, legendary son
        King of clouds, important rambler
        stooping down to conquer everyone

        Somewhere a card has been turned
        out there a star no longer burns
        Your face has never been clear
        but I'm caught in the thought of having you here

        Wild angel, child no more
        wild angel, the most original person I know
        Wild angel, gonna keep calling you, calling you
        wild angel, come back home

        When I think of revenge
        my heart does hurt
        Then I see you again
        and I button up my shirt

        I do suffer for my sins
        with you my suffering begins
        Your face has never been clear
        and I'm caught in the thought of having you here

        Wild angel, child no more
        wild angel, should have been back a long time before
        Wild angel, gonna keep calling you, calling you
        calling you, calling you, come back home
        Calling you, calling you, come back home
        calling you, calling you, come back home
        Calling you, calling you, come back home
        calling you, calling you, come back home
        Calling you, calling you, come back home
        calling you, calling you, come back home
        Calling you, calling you, come back home
        calling you, calling you, come back home

"Wild Child"
===================
album _Lou Reed_
(Lou Reed, 1972)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        I was talking to Chuck in his Ghengis Khan suit
        and his wizard's hat
        He spoke of his movie and how he was making
        a new soundtrack

        And then we spoke of kids on the coast
        and different types of organic soap
        And the way suicides don't leave notes
        Then we spoke of Lorraine
        always back to Lorraine

        I was speaking to Phil who was given to pills
        and small racing cars
        He had given 'em up since his last crack-up
        had carried him too far

        Then we spoke of movies and verse
        and the way an actress held her purse
        And the way life at times could get worse
        Then we spoke of Lorraine
        always back to Lorraine

        Ah, she's a wild child
        and nobody can get at her
        She's a wild child
        oh, and nobody can get to her

        Sleeping out on the street
        Oh, living all alone
        without a house or a home
        and then she asked you, please
        hey baby, can I have some spare change
        Oh, can I break your heart

        She's a wild child
        she's a wild child

        I was talking to Betty about her auditions
        how they made her ill
        The life of the theater is certainly fraught
        with many spills and chills

        But she calmed down after some wine
        which is what happens most of the time
        Then we sat and both spoke in rhyme
        Till we spoke of Lorraine
        ah, it's always back to Lorraine

        I was talking to Ed who'd been reported dead
        by mutual friends
        He thought it was funny that I had no money
        to spend on him

        So we both shared a piece of sweet cheese
        and sang of our lives and our dreams
        And how things can come apart at the seams
        And we talked of Lorraine
        always back to Lorraine

        She's a wild child
        oh, and nobody can get at her
        She's a wild child
        oh, and nobody can get to her

        Sleeping out on the street
        Oh, living all alone
        without a house or a home
        and then she asked you, please
        oh baby, can I have some spare change
        Now can I break your heart

        She's a wild child
        she's a wild child

"Wild Child"
===============================
album _Le Bataclan '72_
(Lou Reed/John Cale/Nico, 2003)

Jan 29, 1972
Le Bataclan, Paris, France
===============================


        I was talking to Chuck in his Ghengis Khan suit
        and his wizard's hat
        We were talking about the movie he made
        and his new soundtrack

        Then we talked about kids on the coast
        and different kinds of organic soap
        And the way suicides don't leave notes
        Then we talked about Lorraine
        it always gets back to Lorraine

        I was talking to Phil, he was addicted to pills
        and small racing cars
        He'd given 'em up since his last crack-up
        had carried him too far

        Then we spoke of rhythm and verse
        about the different ways an actress can hold her purse
        And the way life at times could get worse
        Then we talked 'bout Lorraine
        it always comes down to Lorraine

        She's a wild child
        and nobody can get at her
        She's a wild child
        woh, nobody can get to her

        Sleeping out on the street
        Woh, living all alone
        without a house or a home
        and then she asked you, hey please
        hey baby, can I have some spare change
        Can I break your heart

        She's a wild child
        she's a wild child

        I was..

        I was talking to Betty about her auditions
        somehow they made her so ill
        You know that life of the theater is certainly fraught
        with many spills and chills, ah

        Then she settled down after some wine
        which is what happens most of the time
        Then we both sat and spoke in rhyme
        Till we'll be back to Lorraine
        it always gets back to Lorraine

        I'd been talking to Ed who'd been reported dead
        by some mutual friends
        He thought it was funny that I had no money
        to spend on him

        Then we sat down and ate some sweet cheese
        and talked about our lives and our dreams
        And the way things can come apart at the seams
        Then we talked about Lorraine
        it always gets back to Lorraine, oh

        She's a wild child
        yeah, nobody can get at her
        She's a wild child
        and nobody can get to her

        Sleeping out on the streets
        Woh, living all alone
        without a house or a home
        then she asked you, hey please
        baby, can I have some spare change
        Can I break your heart

        She's a wild child
        she's a wild child
        She's a wild child

"Winter Song"
====================
album _Chelsea Girl_
(Nico, 1967)

written by John Cale

Lou Reed: guitar
====================


        The snow on your eyelids that curtsy with age
        is freezing the stares on tyranny's wings
        The bitter is hard and the warmth of your skin
        is diseased with familiar caresses

        Withdrawing from splendor and royal decay
        among all the triumphs and jaded awards
        The angry and blazing circus of sun
        blasphemes as the crown prince arises

        You cannot beget all the sins that you owe
        to the people of paradise magic
        Pretend to answer passion and form
        with foreign rationalizations

        Primroses are the jewels that lurk
        among masks of pleasure that flicker with doubt
        Embraces of fame that's simultaneously fear
        to advance and demand to be recognized

        The river shall flow through hollow green faces
        of caricature's resentment etched out of the tongues
        Both reluctant princess asleep before birth
        the classical sensitive failures

        The worshipping wicked cling to the dark of your heart
        lying there and wait with your angels
        Moan and ravish from dawn to dusk
        the avaricious young lovers

"With You"
================================
album _The Bells_
(Lou Reed, 1979)

written by Lou Reed/Nils Lofgren
================================


        With you, life moves so fast
        with you, everything's a mess
        Slow down

        Don't you think you could be less capricious
        I'm not you, I don't have no death wish
        Slow down
        slow down

        With you, there is no denying
        it's you, not my lack of trying
        With you, everybody's lying
        it's you, it's not me who's crying
        Crying, crying
        crying, crying

        With you, stay and hold tightly from the streets
        with you, every friend's a possible beat
        Slow down
        slow down

        With you, it's a foregone conclusion
        with you, envy, it's all a delusion
        With you, I can have no illusions
        it's you, who has the contusions
        Crying, crying
        crying, crying

        With you, everyone's a sucker
        with you, it's fuckee or fucker
        Slow down
        slow down

        With you, life is just a scramble
        with you, every day is a gamble
        With you, I can forget life barely
        with you, playing the Virgin Mary
        And you're crying, crying
        crying, crying
        Crying, crying

"Women"
=====================
album _The Blue Mask_
(Lou Reed, 1982)

written by Lou Reed
=====================


        I love women, I think they're great
        they're a solace to the world in a terrible state
        They're a blessing to the eyes, a balm to the soul
        what a nightmare to have no women in the world

        I love women
        I love women
        I love women
        we all love women

        I used to look at women in the magazines
        I know that it was sexist, but I was in my teens
        I was very bitter, all my sex was on the sly
        I couldn't keep my hands off women, and I won't till I die

        I love women
        oh, I love women
        we love women
        we all love women

        A woman's love can lift you up, and women can inspire
        I feel like buying flowers and hiring a celestial choir
        A choir of castratis to serenade my love
        they'd sing a little Bach for us and then we'd make love

        I love women
        I love women
        We all love women
        we love women

"Work"
=============================
album _Songs For Drella_
(Lou Reed/John Cale, 1990)

written by Lou Reed/John Cale
=============================


        Andy was a Catholic
        the ethic ran through his bones
        He lived alone with his mother
        collecting gossip and toys

        Every Sunday when he went to church
        he'd kneel in his pew and he'd say
        "It's work
        all that matters is work"

        He was a lot of things
        what I remember the most
        He'd say, "I've got to bring home the bacon
        someone's got to bring home the roast"

        He'd get to the Factory early
        if you'd ask him he'd a told you straight out
        "It's work"

        No matter what I did it never seemed enough
        he said I was lazy, I said I was young
        He said, "How many songs did you write?"
        I'd written zero, I lied and said, "Ten"

        "You won't be young forever
        you should have written fifteen"
        It's work

        "You ought to make things big
        people like it that way
        And the songs with the dirty words
        make sure your record them that way"

        Andy liked to stir up trouble
        he was funny that way
        He said, "It's just work"

        Andy sat down to talk one day
        he said, "Decide what you want"
        "Do you want to expand your parameters
        or play museums like some dilettante"

        I fired him on the spot
        he got red and he called me a rat
        It was the worst word that he could think of
        I'd never seen him like that
        It was work
        I thought he said it's just work

        Andy said a lot of things
        I stored them all away in my head
        Sometimes when I can't decide what I should do
        I think what would Andy have said

        He'd probably say, "You think too much
        that's 'cause there's work that you don't want to do"
        It's work
        the most important thing is work
        It's work
        the most important thing is work

"Wrap Your Troubles In Dreams"
==============================
album _Chelsea Girl_
(Nico, 1967)

written by Lou Reed

Lou Reed: guitar
==============================


        Wrap your troubles in dreams
        send them all away
        Put them in a bottle and
        across the seas they'll stay

        Speak not of misfortune
        speak not of your woes
        Just steel yourself for holy death
        crouching by the door

        Writhe and sway to music's pain
        searing with asides
        Caress death with a lover's touch
        for it shall be your bride

        Wrap your troubles in dreams
        send them all away
        Put them in a bottle
        and across the seas they'll stay

        Slash the golden whip it snaps
        across the lovers' sides
        The earth trembles without remorse
        preparing for to die

        Salty ocean waves and sprays
        come crashing to the shore
        Bullies kick and kill young loves
        down on barroom floors

        Wrap your troubles in dreams
        send them all away
        Put them in a bottle
        and across the seas they'll stay

        Violence echoes through the land
        and heart of every man
        The knife stabs existent wounds
        pus runs through matted hair

        The gleaming knife cuts early
        through the midnight air
        Cutting entrails in its path
        blood runs without care

        Excrements filters through the brain
        hatred bends the spine
        Filth covers the body pores
        to be cleansed by dying time

        Wrap your troubles in dreams
        send them all away
        Put them in a bottle
        and across the seas they'll stay

"Xmas In February"
===================
album _New York_
(Lou Reed, 1989)

written by Lou Reed
===================


        Sam was lyin' in the jungle
        agent orange spread against the sky like marmalade
        Hendrix played on some foreign jukebox
        they were praying to be saved
        Those gooks were fierce and fearless
        that's the price you pay when you invade
        Xmas in February

        Sam lost his arm in some border town
        his fingers are mixed with someone's crop
        If he didn't have that opium to smoke
        the pain would never ever stop
        Half his friends are stuffed into black body bags
        with their names printed at the top
        Xmas in February

        Sammy was a short order cook
        in a short order black and blue collar town
        Everybody worked the steel mill
        but the steel mill got closed down
        He thought if he joined the Army
        he'd have a future that was sound
        Like no Xmas in February

        Sam's staring at the Vietnam wall
        it's been a while now that he's home
        His wife and kid have left, he's unemployed
        he's a reminder of the war that wasn't won
        He's that guy on the street with the sign that reads
        "Please help send this Vet home"
        But he is home
        and there's no Xmas in February
        no matter how much he saves

"You Can't Relive The Past"
=================================
album _You Can't Relive The Past_
(Eric Andersen, 2000)

written by Eric Andersen/Lou Reed

Lou Reed: vocals, acoustic guitar
=================================


        What's said is said, what's done is done
        you can't relive the past
        The water's blown and so's the bridge
        you can't relive the past
        Memory runs right by your eyes
        so real and so fast
        the dam is burst the acid's spilt
        you can't relive the past

        You can't relive the past
        you can't relive the past
        the dam is burst the acid's spilt
        you can't relive the past

        I sat beauty on my knees
        you can't relive the past
        I ran my guns for Robert E. Lee
        you can't relive the past
        One lesson learned from poetry
        you can't hide behind a mask
        no mask could hide your liberty
        you can't relive the past

        You can't relive the past
        you can't relive the past
        no mask could hide your liberty
        you can't relive the past

        Your life turns grey, the kids leave school
        it's so subtle, it's so cruel
        your knee has gotten rusty
        the wild west got taped fast
        You sit with your remote control
        you can't relive the past

        You can't relive the past
        you can't relive the past
        you sit with you remote control
        you can't relive the past

        Amuse yourself with anything
        you can't relive the past
        mistakes are what they'll always be
        you can't relive the past
        The many things you thought you'd save
        were like stocks in a crash
        your future's now just gettin' up
        you can't relive the past, no

        You can't relive the past
        you can't relive the past
        your future's now just gettin' up
        you can't relive the past

        Did you really think this world would change
        you can't relive the past
        reality's not what headlines say
        you can't relive the past
        Then suddenly it's all over
        before the sail reached the top most mast
        you're driftin' like a wooden doll
        you can't relive the past

        You can't relive the past
        you can't relive the past
        oh, you're driftin' like a wooden doll
        you can't relive the past

        I walked out to Dexter Street
        at the crossroads I heard a saxophone
        so many loves are dead and gone
        so many lives have crashed
        I'll never know what to make of it
        but you can't relive the past

        You can't relive the past
        you can't relive the past
        I'll never know what to make of it
        but you can't relive the past

        I wake up now that's all I know
        you can't relive the past
        the future's constant tyranny
        you can't relive the past
        Tomorrow I might drew a map
        but most plans never last
        still it's fun thought you know
        you can't relive the past, no

        You can't relive the past
        you can't relive the past
        still it's fun thought you know
        you can't relive the past

        You can't relive the past
        you can't relive the past
        still it's fun thought you know
        you can't relive the past

album _Greetings From The Gutter_
(Dave Stewart, 1994)

written by David A. Stewart

Lou Reed: guitar solo
==================================


        You laugh a lot, yes, you -
        - talk a lot, oh, you -
        - never stop, no, you -
        - never stop, but you -
        - Never talk about the way you feel
        The way we make each other feel

        You celebrate
        and cut a cake, oh, you -
        - couldn't wait, no, you -
        - couldn't wait, but you -
        - Never thought about the way I'd feel
        The way you made somebody feel

        Do you believe in all you hear
        your husband's sick, your sister's queer
        your mouth is full of shaky teeth
        from dreams that make you disbelieve
        That all I've ever said and done
        was wish you well and have some fun

        Have some fun
        have some fun

=============================
"You'll Know You Were Loved"
=============================
album _Friends_
(Original Soundtrack, 1995)

CDEP "Hooky Wooky"
(Lou Reed, 1996)

written by Lou Reed

* a.k.a.
"You'll Never Know You Loved"
=============================


        Some things come to he who waits
        but all is lost if you hesitate
        And I was never one to wait
        you'll know you were loved

        You can hire great lawyers, you can speak to your friends
        you can say he did this and that, some things don't change
        Unwrap the present and burn the remains
        but you'll know you were loved

        Now you take Roscoe he ain't much
        people say things are ruined after his touch
        It's like a tar was dripping from his brush
        but you'll know you were loved

        Or Stan or Jake emerging from your past
        from those love affairs that didn't last
        But me, I'll give it my last gasp
        and you'll know you were loved

        A parrot, a donkey, a dog, a bone
        some of us never had a home
        And if we did we left it long ago
        and didn't know we were loved

        Empty as a wooden clock
        left in the woods at twelve o'clock
        Insides all rusted, the spring is popped
        but you'll know you were loved

        Even when you sleep at night
        inside your heart will cry
        You can never say goodbye
        when you know you were loved

        Under-achievers of the world unite
        you have nothing to lose except your fright
        And together we can perhaps past the night
        when you know you were loved

        And together we can perhaps past the night
        when you know you were loved

"You'll know you were loved"


Some things come to...
but all is lost...
and I was never want to wait
You'll know you were loved

You can hire great lawyers
You can speech to your friends
You can say...that
Some things don't change
Unwrap the present and burn the remains but
You'll know you were loved

Now you take...
People say things...after his touch
It's like a...dripping from his brush? but,
You'll know you were loved

...emerging from your past
From those love affairs that didn't last
But me, I'll give it my last...
You'll know you were loved

...a donkey, a dog, a bone
Some...never had a home and 
if we did we left it long ago
and didn't know we were loved

Empty as a wooden clock
Left in the woods at twelve o'clock
inside all...the spring is popped
but, you'll know you were loved

Even when you sleep at night
Inside your heart will cry
and you can never say goodbye
when you'll know you were loved

Under a...world deny
You have nothing to lose except your fright and
...we can...past a night
When you know you were loved

And together we can perhaps past a night
When you'll know you were loved.

So when i found That the lyrics you have listed of this song
where either inaccurate or missing whole lines.
I decided to send you what i am confident
is the full and complete lyrics of "You'll know you were loved"
off the "freinds soundtrack"



"You'll know you were loved"


Some things come to he who waits
but all is lost if you hesitate.
and  I was never one to wait
You'll know you were loved

You can hire great lawyers
You can speak to your friends
You can say he did this and that
Some things don't change
Unwrap the present and burn the remains 
but You'll know you were loved

Now you take Roscoe he ain't much..
People say things are ruined after his touch
It's like a tar was dripping from his brush
but, You'll know you were loved

or Stan or Jake emerging from your past
From those love affairs that didn't last
But me, I'll give it my last  gasp
and You'll know you were loved

a parrot, a donkey, a dog, a bone
Some of us never had a home and 
if we did we left it long ago
and didn't know we were loved

Empty as a wooden clock
Left in the woods at twelve o'clock
insides all rusted and spring is popped
but, you'll know you were loved

Even when you sleep at night
Inside your heart will cry
you can never say good-bye
when you know you were loved

Under-achievers of the world unite
You have nothing to lose except your fright
and together we can perhaps pass a night
When you know you were loved

And together we can perhaps pass a night
When you'll know you were loved.
